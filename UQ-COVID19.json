{"\u2018Flabbergasted\u2019: Melbourne-based One Nation candidate running in north Queensland seat [2022-05-04T17:30:14Z]": "The Greens, Katter\u2019s Australian Party and pro-climate action independents don\u2019t often sing from the same songbook. But One Nation\u2019s fielding of a candidate from suburban Melbourne to represent the north Queensland city of Townsville has drawn a chorus of condemnation from those rival candidates, one of whom says she is \u201cflabbergasted and disgusted\u201d by the move. It was not long after midday on 22 April that a representative from the Australian Electoral Commission read aloud the order in which candidates would appear on the ballot for the seat of Herbert.   Related: One Nation running candidates in states where they don\u2019t live, as emails reveal scramble to fill seats    There were 11 candidates, but one name stood out: Diane Pepe. It was not Pepe\u2019s party \u2013 One Nation \u2013 which raised eyebrows , but her home address in Pakenham, Victoria. Pepe was not present at the event, but most of the other candidates were, the Katter\u2019s Australian party candidate Clynton Hawks said. \u201cWhen they said \u2018Victoria\u2019, we all looked around at one another,\u201d Hawks told Guardian Australia. \u201cVictoria is classed as Mexico in my books. They get all the gold paved roads and the nice new trains, while up here in north Queensland we fight for the crumbs. \u201cYou are supposed to be representing the people and this person is a ring-in from three states away?\u201d An AEC spokesperson confirmed Pepe\u2019s address in Pakenham \u2013 in Melbourne\u2019s outer south-east \u2013 was read out at the declaration of nominations. The spokesperson \u200b\u200bsaid a candidate was not required to live in the division that they are contesting. A doctor running as an independent, Angela Egan, and the Greens candidate, Scott Humphreys, said they were as shocked as Hawks. \u201cI was flabbergasted and disgusted,\u201d Egan said. Egan said she had never heard of Pepe prior to her name being read out and had not seen her since. \u201cThis is exactly why I am standing,\u201d she said. \u201cTo give people a local, independent option. Not even being in the state of Queensland, that\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d One Nation secured 11.09% of primary votes in Herbert at the 2019 election, more than the KAP, the Greens and the UAP, and behind only the two major parties. In such a crowded field, preferences proved crucial to electing the Liberal National party\u2019s Phillip Thompson, whose primary vote was 37.11%. Pepe was contacted for comment. Her husband answered the phone but stopped responding after questions about her address. A private Facebook page under Diane Pepe\u2019s name, last updated in late 2020 and displaying pro-One Nation and anti-Covid-19 vaccine-mandate posts, lists her as living in Melbourne.  Pepe does not appear to have any official social media presence as a candidate and, as of Wednesday afternoon, her profile was not listed on One Nation\u2019s candidates page. Her current Australian Business Number is linked to her address in Pakenham, stretching back to at least 2007. One Nation was asked where Pepe lived but did not respond.    Graeme Orr, a politics expert at the University of Queensland (UQ), said there was \u201cnothing morally or normatively wrong\u201d in candidates living outside their electorates and that One Nation was not the only party to do so. Orr cited the example of Kennedy, where Bob Katter has held a stranglehold and, in the past, a Labor candidate might have been on a \u201chiding to nothing\u201d. \u201cSo they might get a UQ student who\u2019s an activist, to be the dummy,\u201d Orr said. \u201cBut people living in Kennedy, who want to vote Labor, are entitled to have a Labor choice \u2013 we do have a party-based system.\u201d One Nation, he said, was a \u201cgenuine party with a history\u201d and was entitled to do similarly. The question was: why they had done so in a seat in which they polled so strongly in 2019?   Related: LNP preferences could be \u2018deciding factor\u2019 for One Nation in Queensland    \u201cOne Nation, we\u2019d always presumed, had a reasonably strong nationwide set of activists and supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that may be a false assumption based on 20 odd years ago, when Hanson exploded on the scene.\u201d Greg Dowling, a former rugby league footballer, is representing Clive Palmer\u2019s party in Herbert; the previously One Nation-linked Steve Clare is running as an independent; while the the Great Australian party and the Informed Medical Options party are also running candidates, in addition to KAP. \u201c[One Nation] are not an astroturf party, they\u2019re not even a Palmer party,\u201d Orr said. \u201cAt previous elections where they might have been expected to do well, One Nation would get a swell of genuine of activists. But now they\u2019re competing for candidates as well as activists with four or five or six other parties \u2026 There may just be too much competition on the libertarian right.\u201d Pepe\u2019s does not appear to be an isolated case. The Guardian has seen internal emails that show One Nation was still desperate to find people to run for it just hours before the nominating deadline on 21 April, telling one prospective candidate that the party didn\u2019t \u201crequire you to do anything or campaign at all\u201d. A similar, 11th hour scramble appears to have occurred with One Nation\u2019s preference deals. Last week, the party\u2019s candidate for the marginal seat of Longman \u2013 where One Nation preferences could prove decisive \u2013 told Guardian Australia that preference recommendations were his call and that he would be putting the LNP last. In contrast to Pepe, Ross Taylor\u2019s picture and profile appear on One Nation\u2019s website. The local electrician\u2019s contact details are publicly available, and when contacted, Taylor spoke with some authority about his electorate and the issues that had been raised to him on the campaign trail. Taylor clearly wanted to win and believes he can do so. Asked about how he would recommend his voters order their preferences, Taylor texted a written list which had the LNP incumbent Terry Young last.   Related: In kaleidoscopic Longman, the status quo is dead. Who will voters turn to?    \u201cI made the final decision yesterday in consultation with HQ, just making sure that we get it right, making sure I\u2019m in a position where I can actually win,\u201d he said last week. Within days, however, Hanson had announced One Nation would preference the LNP in every seat in Queensland. Asked about this on Monday, Taylor confirmed that his preferences had since been \u201cmodified\u201d. By this point, Taylor had party-endorsed, printed how-to-vote cards, which had Young now at fifth, Labor at sixth, the Animal Justice party at seventh and the Greens last. Taylor said he couldn\u2019t remember when the order was modified but denied he had been railroaded into the changes by party operatives. \u201cI just can\u2019t put a Labor party in and I can\u2019t put a Greens party in at all, there\u2019s just no way, gotta put them down the bottom,\u201d he said. He noted that Young\u2019s how-to-vote card had since preferenced One Nation second. The LNP is recommending its Queensland voters preference One Nation second on their senate ballots, a move some political analysts believe could be \u201cthe deciding factor\u201d that sees Pauline Hanson re-elected.", "University of Queensland Covid vaccine: the government's pulled the plug so what happens now? [2020-12-11T05:26:11Z]": "The Australian government has terminated its agreement with Australian biotech company CSL Limited to supply 51m doses of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland. \nWhat happened and what does this mean for Australia\u2019s supply of Covid-19 vaccines? We take a closer look. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nWhat was the finding that caused the trial to be halted? \nPhase one of the study, involving 216 trial participants, found the vaccine provoked a strong immune response against Covid-19, halting replication. The only side effects in some participants were pain at the injection site, and headaches, which is normal for most vaccines, so safety was not an issue.  \nThe researchers also found the vaccine generated antibodies towards the \u201cmolecular clamp\u201d, which led to a false positive result when participants were tested for HIV. University of Queensland researchers pioneered the molecular clamp technology long before Covid-19 existed, patenting it in 2018. A molecular clamp is a chain between proteins that stabilises the shape of proteins in experimental vaccines. \nThe Covid-19 spike protein has been the focus of UQ and other vaccines because it is the part of the virus that enables it to enter human cells, where it replicates. However, when synthetic versions of these spike proteins are used in vaccines, they become unstable and can change. This means that the immune system may not recognise the protein as Covid-19, and the correct immune response to protect against it won\u2019t be triggered. \nThis is where the UQ\u2019s molecular clamp comes in. It locks the \u201cspike\u201d protein into a shape, stabilising it, and this allows the immune system to be able to recognise and then neutralise the Covid-19 virus. The clamp chosen by UQ researchers comprises two fragments of the glycoprotein 41 protein found in HIV, as those fragments provided the greatest stability to the spike protein.  \n \n  Related: The UK is about to start vaccinating against Covid-19. Why isn't Australia?  \n \nResearchers thought the risk of these fragments triggering an HIV immune response was low, but ultimately found during the trial that those who received the vaccine did produce a very low-level antibody response.  \nWho made the decision to halt the trial and why? \nThe phase one trial will continue, and participants will be still be monitored over coming months. But the recruitment and participation of thousands more participants for phase two and three clinical trials will not go ahead in December as planned. Phase three trials are the final stage needed before a vaccine is rolled out to the general public. \nThe decision was a joint one made by the Australian government, CSL, and the University of Queensland researchers in consultation with HIV experts and the national security committee of cabinet. There are a number of reasons for this. \nThe federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said public support of the vaccine and belief in its safety was essential. The news that the vaccine could trigger a HIV immune response may deter some people, even though it is a harmless response. \n\u201cThe risk to vaccine confidence was the principal issue here, and we made the decision unanimously as a national security committee, the scientific advice was unanimous, the agreement with CSL not to proceed was mutual,\u201d Hunt said. \nIf hundreds of thousands of Australians received the vaccine, then began receiving positive HIV test results this would be concerning. Even if the test would later be proven to be a false positive, this may nonetheless cause unnecessary stress to the roughly 1 million people who get tested for HIV each year. \nSo the other underlying issue was the vaccine\u2019s interference with HIV diagnostic testing. \nCSL\u2019s chief scientific officer, Dr Andrew Nash, said if there were no other promising vaccine candidates, then the researchers could be justified in pushing ahead with the vaccine and dealing with the false positives. But other vaccine candidates, including the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine, have already produced promising phase three clinical trial results. \nWhy not just change HIV tests so they don\u2019t respond to the vaccine? \nThis was an option considered by the UQ and CSL team. They consulted with leading HIV experts to see if current HIV testing technology could be changed. It\u2019s a testament to the quality of HIV diagnostic tests that they could even pick up the low levels of antibodies triggered by the vaccine in the first place. \nBut Dr Russell Basser, who is part of the research and development team, said: \u201cWe worked with HIV specialists and laboratory specialists to map out a different way of screening for HIV.\u201d \n\u201cIt just seemed to get harder and harder, the more we looked at it,\u201d he said. \n\u201cCombined with the fact that the antibody levels declined, though not particularly rapidly at this stage, we felt the burden was probably too great.\u201d \nWhy not just change the molecular clamp and use something other than the HIV fragments? \nThis is possible, but it would take time \u2013 at least 12 months. \nProf Paul Young, UQ\u2019s head of the school of chemistry and molecular bioscience, said if the virus ends up being endemic within the community, and people require repeat vaccines every year, then there is an option of moving forward with a different molecular clamp down the track. \nBasser added: \u201cWe\u2019ve left no stone unturned in trying to establish if this could be rolled out in a sensible and reasonable way.\u201d But for now, it doesn\u2019t make sense. \nWhat are the implications for the rollout of Australia\u2019s vaccine program? \nAustralia had ordered 51m units of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, which were expected to be available from mid-2021. With that vaccine now off the table, the government is increasing production and purchase of the AstraZeneca vaccine from 33.8m units to 53.8m units, and units of the Novavax vaccine have been increased from 40m to 51m. \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine will be manufactured in Melbourne by CSL from early 2021 in monthly batches, so producing extra units of that vaccine will be straightforward. The AstraZeneca vaccine alone could cover the entire Australian population. Phase three clinical trials for the Novavax vaccine are already under way, so that timeline was already ahead of the UQ one. \nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia has \u201cone of the highest ratios of vaccine purchases and availability to population in the world\u201d. He said there was even the potential for a slightly earlier completion of the vaccination schedule, with the government aiming to vaccinate the entire population by the end of 2021. \nAre there any concerns for the people involved in the UQ/CSL trial? \nThe HIV antibodies are harmless. Researchers said the risk of the vaccine triggering a HIV response was outlined on the consent form signed by trial participants. There is no risk to participants of developing HIV. The participants have been regularly updated throughout the trial. \n \n  Related: Qantas boss says all international travellers on airline will have to have vaccination  \n \nOne of the trial participants told the ABC: \u201cWe were told clearly at the start there was a tiny HIV inactive fragment, one part of it, which was part of the building block of the vaccine, [and] that there was a chance that we could test positive \u2026 We were all well across that, the organisers of the vaccine trial were very good with communicating everything all the way through.\u201d \nWho will bear the cost of the UQ vaccine the government had ordered? \nThe Australian government has invested more than $3.3bn across the four vaccine agreements. \nAsked if the investment into the vaccine was money wasted, Morrison told reporters on Friday: \u201cWe will continue to support and fund the work that they\u2019re doing on molecular clamp research on vaccines, which has application in many other areas\u201d. \n\u201cYou need to spread your investments to give as much opportunity for the most successful vaccines to go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased we backed the world class researchers at the University of Queensland. And my message simply to them today is thank you and all the best with your continued work. You are life savers and we\u2019re incredibly proud of you.\u201d \nA CSL spokeswoman said: \u201cThe details of our agreement with government remain commercial in confidence. As noted in the ASX press release, CSL does not anticipate this announcement will have any impact on previously provided financial guidance for FY2021.\u201d \nHow have the researchers working on the vaccine reacted? \nUQ\u2019s Paul Young said: \u201cI think there\u2019s probably a single word that sums it up. \u2018Devastated\u2019.\u201d \n\u201cThe last 24 hours or so have been particularly difficult for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last 11 months we\u2019ve been living and breathing this particular project, not only members of the team but their families have all been involved so it\u2019s challenging times. But that\u2019s science. It doesn\u2019t always work. We will pick ourselves up, move forward, and develop the next strategy.\u201d", "\u2018Stuffed\u2019: how Australia\u2019s \u2018unconscionable\u2019 gamble on Covid vaccines backfired [2021-07-09T20:00:03Z]": "Eight months ago, Scott Morrison faced the cameras in a laboratory in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs and promised hope after a torrid year. \u201cToday is another day when we can look forward to a much better 2021,\u201d he said. The cause of his optimism was the belated signing of a deal for 10m Pfizer doses and an as-yet unfilled agreement to secure Novavax. The vaccines were to ensure Australia was \u201cin the leading pack of the world\u201d during the pandemic\u2019s next phase. Australia was, in fact, more than four months behind its allies in securing Pfizer. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Canada had all struck agreements with Pfizer in July and August 2020, and the company was expecting to produce 1.3bn doses to satisfy global demand. Not only was Australia late to the party, its order was minuscule. At two doses a person, the Pfizer order was enough to vaccinate one-fifth of Australia\u2019s population, not accounting for wastage.    From his home in Connecticut, Pfizer\u2019s former president of global R&amp;D, John LaMattina, has been closely observing the global rush for vaccines, including Australia\u2019s efforts to procure doses. He says Australia\u2019s delay in securing a deal with Pfizer, while \u201cunfortunate\u201d, was understandable, because the success in containing Covid-19 had afforded it more time than others. But the amount Australia eventually secured in November was \u201cclearly lacking\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d. \u201cOnce the amazing and unprecedented efficacy of the mRNA vaccines was established, ordering a mere 10m doses was unconscionable,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen both Pfizer and Moderna demonstrated the potent efficacy of their vaccines, every country should immediately have reached out to these companies to place their orders. \u201cIn the case of Australia, enough vaccine to inoculate its entire population over the age of 18 should have been done at once. Assuming that is about 20m Australians, this would have cost about US$780m \u2026 How much has Australia spent on Covid-19 relief packages?\u201d Instead Australia planned to make AstraZeneca and the University of Queensland vaccine the workhorses of its rollout. Both brought the valuable option of domestic production at CSL\u2019s Melbourne facility. Time casts those decisions in a poor light. The UQ vaccine failed to get out of the starting gate, scuppered due to its tendency to generate false HIV positives. AstraZeneca has had its own well-publicised problems, greatly inhibiting its use among younger Australians and sending the government scurrying for more Pfizer. But was this just a case of bad luck? Are critics suffering hindsight bias? Or did our procurement strategy gamble too narrowly?   chart   The former health department secretary Stephen Duckett believes the early procurement decisions have been one of the major, compounding failures of the rollout. \u201cIf you think about it in terms of what business people call \u2018portfolio theory\u2019, you have to have a mixture of investments so you can mitigate your risk if one strategy doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the failures was this failure to diversify back in July. \u201cSo when AstraZeneca fell over, when UQ fell over, they were stuffed.\u201d Australia remains almost the worst performing OECD nation on Covid-19 vaccinations, behind countries such as Costa Rica and Latvia. A \u2018sliding doors\u2019 moment The first sign of Pfizer\u2019s eagerness to do a deal with Australia came in the middle of last year. A letter from Pfizer, dated 30 June, invited Australian government officials for discussions about its mRNA vaccine \u2013 at that stage still in development. A meeting was scheduled within a fortnight. It was the first of a series of 11 formal meetings and ad hoc phone calls between Pfizer and Australian officials. The first, on 10 July, has been the subject of intense controversy. In the room were Pfizer\u2019s Australian executives and a group of government lawyers and senior health officials, including Lisa Schofield, the first assistant secretary in the government\u2019s Covid taskforce. \u201cPfizer said: \u2018This is a vaccine that we are developing,\u2019 \u201d Schofield told a Senate inquiry. \u201cWe said that we were interested in talking to them about potentially purchasing that vaccine, but that was it. No numbers or details were put on the table at that discussion on 10 July.\u201d But a different account has emerged in the reporting of Norman Swan, the host of the ABC\u2019s Coronacast podcast. Citing unnamed sources, he reported that one Australian official was belligerent, tried to haggle over the price, and demanded access to intellectual property. The conversations continued but no deal was struck, in his account. Then acting Victorian premier James Merlino has also spoken of a huge offer made by Pfizer to the Australian government at the time of the first meeting. \u201cOur nation had a \u2018sliding doors\u2019 moment last July,\u201d he said. \u201cLast July, there was an offer of Pfizer to the commonwealth government that would be enough for our country, and they didn\u2019t take it up.\u201d    The suggestion is flatly denied by the health department. Schofield insisted Pfizer made the Australian government no offer in \u201cany level of detail\u201d. The government also insists that 10m doses was all that Pfizer had available for Australia when a deal was eventually struck in November. Pfizer says it was responsible for proposing the 10m figure. \u201cOur discussions are confidential, however the supply of vaccine in Australia was developed following consultation with the Australian government and each agreement was based on the availability of doses and earliest schedule that could be provided at that time,\u201d it told a Senate inquiry. The government denies that it failed to build up a broad portfolio of vaccines, saying it secured five agreements that would provide 195m doses combined. It also insists it entered into an advanced purchase agreement with Pfizer as soon as it could, acting on the advice of its science and industry technical advisory group. \u201cRecent media reports about the Department of Health\u2019s engagement with Pfizer have been written without any input from the department,\u201d the department said. \u201cWhile these are largely commercial-in-confidence discussions, the level of engagement with the company and categorisation of those discussions has been grossly misrepresented.\u201d Demand for Pfizer soars Wherever the truth lies, it is clear that at the time of that initial meeting, Pfizer was not shy about making deals. In July alone it reached agreement to supply 100m doses to the US, 120m to Japan and 30m to the UK. Citing internal documents, Reuters reported that Pfizer also offered 500m doses to the European Union in July, which were turned down due to cost. Australia eventually doubled its Pfizer order in February. By that stage global demand had gone through the roof \u2013 in November the company forecast it would need to produce 1.3bn doses, but by February that had risen to 2bn. Pfizer soon began warning of delays to Australia\u2019s shipments. \u201cWe have had a huge number of requests for additional doses from around the world, and certainly that has scaled up even further after our clinical trials came out showing safety and efficacy,\u201d Australian managing director Anne Harris said in January. Three months ago, Australia ordered 20m more doses.   chart   The move came late. The Australian technical advisory group on immunisation (Atagi) had already recommended Pfizer as the preferred vaccine for under-50s. Demand for Pfizer grew further when Atagi raised the age to 60, and again after a damaging war of words between the federal and Queensland governments over the safety of AstraZeneca for under-40s. Many younger Australians are being told by their GPs to wait for Pfizer, but there is no firm date for when that will be for under-40s. \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 Last week a nation once told it was at the front of the queue for vaccines was suddenly told it was at the back. It came as little surprise to a fatigued public, or to state premiers who have begged for more Pfizer as they battle outbreaks and enforce lockdowns. This week Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expressed fury at the state\u2019s supply volume, saying it would be getting only about 65,000 Pfizer doses a week until October when the bulk of the supply is expected to arrive. The state has repeatedly warned it risks running out. On Monday Palaszczuk told her constituents precisely where she thought the blame lay: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on the commonwealth supply so we can make sure that you get your dosage.\u201d    The government \u2013 and its army of rollout consultants \u2013 has had months to learn from its mistakes  Stephen Duckett and Anika Stobart     On the same day, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard gave an equally frank assessment of the supply failings: \u201cUntil we get enough vaccine and enough GPs actually at the frontline able to provide that vaccine into arms, we will continue to have effectively The Hunger Games going on.\u201d The bulk of the mRNA vaccines Australia ordered is not expected to arrive until the third quarter of this year. The federal finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said European countries and drug companies were responsible for the delay because they had favoured countries with high rates of Covid. \u201c[This] has put countries like New Zealand and Australia at the back of the queue in terms of receipt of some of those vaccines,\u201d he said. According to the latest figures provided by the federal health department, 3.2m doses of Pfizer have been administered, and 5m doses of AstraZeneca.   chart   However, many more doses \u2013 16.6m \u2013 have been \u201ccleared\u201d by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for distribution. Of these, 12.3m have been distributed to clinics for use, and 620,000 doses of AstraZeneca have been sent to Timor-Leste and Pacific nations. The health department says 2.3m doses of AstraZeneca are held in contingency to cover second dose allocations. That leaves 1.4m doses which are presumably about to be distributed.   weekly vaccine availablity by type   For the past three weeks that the government has provided figures on vaccine releases, the average has been about 1m new doses a week. The government\u2019s recent document outlining the projected future availability of vaccines shows it plans to increase supply in July and August from about 1m a week to 2.85m of both vaccine. In a recent press conference health minister Greg Hunt confirmed this target, saying he expected an average of 600,000 Pfizer doses to be available \u201cover July\u201d, compared with the 300,000 in the past few weeks. On Friday, Morrison said Pfizer supplies would more than triple in the coming months. \u201cWe have been working with Pfizer now for quite some period of time to bring forward our supplies and I commend minister Hunt and Prof [Brendan] Murphy and Lt Gen [John] Frewen for the great job [getting] those supplies brought forward,\u201d he said.    \u201cThat means we\u2019ve gone from 1.7m in June, 2.8m this month and we will rise to a million a week from 19 July and we will get to 4.5m a month next month. So that\u2019s ramping up.\u201d After Morrison\u2019s statement, Pfizer said there had been no change to the 40m doses it planned to give to Australia. \u201cThe total number of 40m doses we are contracted to deliver to Australia over 2021 has not changed,\u201d it said. Duckett says by October there will be about 2m Pfizer and half a million Moderna doses available each week. That is more than enough to cover the adult population, he says. Duckett says the next step must be to fix the logistical problems that have held up vaccines, widen the distribution channels by setting up more mass vaccination hubs, extending clinic hours and tackling vaccine hesitancy. \u201cThe government \u2013 and its army of rollout consultants \u2013 has had months to learn from its mistakes. The actual army has also been called in,\u201d he and Anika Stobart wrote for the Conversation. \u201cThe government has no excuse not to have all arrangements in place for an efficient vaccination program when the vaccines begin rolling in.\u201d", "Church objections to promising Covid-19 vaccine dismissed by Australia's deputy chief medical officer [2020-08-24T09:40:31Z]": "The deputy chief medical officer, Dr Nick Coatsworth, has downplayed concerns from prominent church figures in Australia that some Christians could refuse a Covid-19 vaccine on ethical grounds. Coatsworth\u2019s defence of the University of Oxford vaccine follows a warning from Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, that Catholics would be presented with an \u201cethical dilemma\u201d if the vaccine was proved successful as it relies on cell lines from an electively aborted fetus. Fisher called on the government to \u201cpursue similar arrangements for alternate vaccines that do not raise the same ethical concerns\u201d about the formulation of the vaccine. The warning, contained in a letter to prime minister Scott Morrison, was also co-signed by the Anglican archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, and the Greek Orthodox archbishop of Australia, Makarios Griniezakis. It noted there are 167 Covid-19 vaccines being researched, with several that don\u2019t use fetal cells in their development.   Related: Here's everything you need to know about the potential Oxford University Covid vaccine    \u201cIt is in the best interests of the community that vaccination is widely taken up and this deadly disease defeated, and this will better be achieved if the vaccines available do not create an ethical quandary,\u201d Fisher wrote on Facebook, when explaining his reasons for sending the letter to Morrison. In the letter, the church leaders warn that \u201cwhile some will have no ethical problem\u201d, others \u201cwill draw a straight line from the ending of a human life in abortion through the cultivation of the cell-line to the use for manufacturing this vaccine\u201d. \u201cEven if the cells have been propagated for years in a laboratory far removed from the abortion, that line of connection remains,\u201d the letter said. The church leaders called for the government not to pressure Australians to use the vaccine if it goes against their religious or moral beliefs, instead asking for an \u201cethically uncontroversial alternative vaccine be made available in Australia if it is achieved\u201d. \u201cPlease be assured that our churches are not opposed to vaccination, as we have said, we are praying that one may be found. But we also pray that it be one that is not ethically tainted.\u201d But Robert Booy, a University of Sydney professor of vaccinology, said vaccines have been developed with cell lines from aborted fetuses for the past 50 years, and that Christian groups had previously accepted their use because of the \u201cbig distance between the cell line and the final vaccine\u201d. He told Guardian Australia vaccines for rubella, hepatitis A and chicken pox all used the same method of development.

So in order to produce vaccines, the virus needs to be grown within the cell repeatedly, and then harvested. Then they get rid of the human element, and purify it just to have the viral element,\u201d Booy said. \u201cThe purification of the virus means they don\u2019t include human DNA in the actual vaccines. Generally people have been comfortable with the idea that a human cell line has been used because it\u2019s a long way distant from the fetus.\u201d Peter Doherty, Nobel laureate and professor of immunology, said while the cell line may be an issue for some Catholics, \u201cscientifically there\u2019s no issue\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s using a cell line that\u2019s been used in lots of applications. It\u2019s our perfect right to take absolutely no intelligence of him,\u201d Doherty said of Fisher. On Monday, Coatsworth said he was aware of Fisher\u2019s concerns, but said \u201cthe reality for the vaccines is that they need cell cultures in order for us to grow them\u201d. \u201cThe human cell is a really important part of their (vaccine) development.\u201d \u201cThere are strong ethical regulations surrounding the use of any human cell, particularly fetal human cells. This is a very professional, highly powered research unit at Oxford University, one of the world\u2019s leading universities, so I think we can have every faith that the way they have manufactured the vaccine has been against the highest of ethical standards internationally,\u201d Coatsworth said.   Related: The threads that don't connect: Covid gives Australian conspiracy theorists a common home    The concern among religious groups about the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine follows the federal government\u2019s announcement last week it had signed a $24.7m agreement with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to supply the vaccine to all Australians for free. A day after announcing the agreement, Morrison was forced to walk back comments the vaccine would be compulsory after experts warned doing so might drive hesitant Australians away. A government spokesperson told Guardian Australia \u201cthe prime minister respects the views of Australia\u2019s many religious communities and understands the issues that are being raised\u201d. \u201cMany vaccines in development do not contain these cell lines, including the UQ [University of Queensland] vaccine candidate which the government is already supporting with $5m.\u201d \u201cThe government will always follow the medical advice and will be encouraging as widespread use of the vaccine or vaccines as is possible,\u201d the spokesperson said. Opposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said \u201cwhen a vaccine is available and it\u2019s rolled out, as many people as possible should get vaccinated\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s my personal view. I say that as a Catholic. That\u2019s the best outcome for Australia. The vaccine is what will get us to the other side of this diabolical health problem with all the economic consequences it brings,\u201d he said.", "Australian production of non-protein Covid-19 vaccine may take an extra year, minister says [2020-10-25T01:22:30Z]": "It could take up to a year for Australian biotech company CSL to develop the capability to make a Covid-19 vaccine if a non-protein-based version proves safe and effective, the country\u2019s industry minister has said. Karen Andrews said CSL would be able to immediately start making a protein-based vaccine, but \u201csignificant work\u201d would be required if it was another type based on mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid. Vaccines traditionally introduce proteins into the body to provoke the immunity system into responding but if an mRNA vaccine of the kind being developed by US company Moderna is approved it would be the first of its type, experts say.   Related: The race for a Covid vaccine: inside the Australian lab working round the clock to produce 100m doses    During an interview with the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, Andrews was pressed to give a timeframe to get production up and running in Australia if an mRNA vaccine was approved. \u201cI would hope that we would be able to do it in about the nine-month to 12-month timeframe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think we need to be really conscious that with a vaccine, there are a lot of variables in there. So we don\u2019t have the vaccine proven at this point in time, we don\u2019t know what the base for that vaccine is going to be, so we are trying to prepare across a wide range.\u201d Andrews said the government would give support to CSL to help it ramp up its capability and roll out technical upgrades \u2013 with some of that work already under way. The rollout of a successful vaccine has implications for opening international borders and restoring a sense of normality to social and economic activity in Australia. The federal budget, released earlier this month, assumed that a population-wide Australian Covid-19 vaccination program would be \u201cfully in place by late 2021\u201d, with social distancing restrictions continuing until a vaccine was available. The health minister, Greg Hunt, moved to assure people later on Sunday that Australia was \u201cvery strongly placed\u201d when it came to securing access to and producing vaccines. \u201cWe in a strong position, we\u2019re progressing, there\u2019s never a guarantee \u2013 but what we know is that we\u2019ve been exceptionally cautious in relation to vaccines and each day the evidence is stronger and the proximity to distribution of that treatment is closer,\u201d Hunt told reporters in Canberra. Hunt said Andrews had been asked a hypothetical question about non-protein vaccines and was \u201cabsolutely right that some of the mRNA ones will take longer\u201d. But he said the protein-based vaccine candidate being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford remained \u201con track for first quarter [2021] commencement and significant rollout during the course of the year [2021]\u201d.   Related: Australian government announces Covid vaccine deals to provide 84.8m doses    \u201cSo our timeframes are unchanged. On the hypothetical if there were no protein-based vaccine, Minister Andrews was 100% correct. But when you take away that hypothetical, when we look at the board reality, Australia is on track for first quarter commencement of that rollout.\u201d Hunt said Australia had reached a deal to access 33.8m units of the Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine, including 3.8m units brought in from overseas in early 2021, subject to approvals in the UK and Australia. He said Australian manufacturing would able to commence and be well under way in the first quarter of 2021. Hunt said CSL was also aiming to make sure that the vaccine developed by the University of Queensland was \u201cavailable during the course of next year \u2013 about the middle of the year\u201d. He said there were contracts for 51m units of the UQ vaccine to be manufactured in Australia throughout 2021.

We\u2019ve had very few deaths due to Covid-19 in Australia in people under the age of 50, and wouldn\u2019t it be terrible that our first 18-year-old in Queensland who dies related to this pandemic died because of the vaccine? \n \nJuly 2021 \n1 July: The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, admits Australia is at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d when it comes to Pfizer and other mRNA vaccines. \n \n European countries and drug companies have favoured those nations who\u2019ve had high rates of Covid for the delivery of vaccines like Pfizer \u2026which has put countries like New Zealand and Australia at the back of the queue in terms of receipt of some of those vaccines.

Thanks as always for reading. Here\u2019s what we learned today:  Further trials of the Australian-led Covid-19 vaccine in development by the University of Queensland and pharmaceutical company CSL were scrapped after some participants in early trials returned false-positive HIV tests. While there was no risk of HIV to the trial participants, researchers said the false-positive results meant significant changes would need to be made to well-established HIV testing procedures to accommodate rollout of the vaccine. The health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, said the design of the vaccine meant scientists had always known the false positive results were a risk. But, he said, it was thought to be \u201ca very, very unlikely possibility\u201d. Despite the setback the prime minister, Scott Morrison, defended the decision to invest in the vaccine, calling it \u201cmoney well spent\u201d. \u201cThe expectation that there would be 100% success rate across all of these is naive. It is just not true,\u201d he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was still in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to roll out Covid-19 vaccines early next year, despite the termination. \u201cJust to let you know, all up, the Australian vaccine portfolio \u2013 53.8 million AstraZeneca units \u2013 that\u2019s enough to cover the whole of population,\u201d he said.

Related: Jimmy Lai charged under national security law as Hong Kong crackdown worsens         6.30am GMT       Pity the Western Australian rock lobster fisheries, whose product is typically exported to China. This year, amid mounting trade tensions, Australia\u2019s big two supermarkets have stepped in to procure large quantities of lobster, which they\u2019re bestowing on the Australian public at bargain basement prices.  First, Woolworths announced it had purchased five times its usual volume of lobster, and would be selling the formerly fancy crustaceans for $20 a pop.  \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to be making them accessible to more families this year, while also supporting the local industry,\u201d Woolworths head of meat and seafood, Tim Dudding, said in a statement. Not to be outdone, Coles quickly declared it had procured 29 times its usual order of Western Australian rock lobster, and would also be selling them for $20 each.  \u201cThis is a fantastic example of how we have been able to act quickly to support our suppliers with an income stream during a very challenging time while also benefiting our customers at the checkout,\u201d Andy Mossop, Coles general manager for bakery, deli and seafood said, also in a statement. Wild-caught western rock lobsters get a green pass from the Good Fish Guide, and the Coles lobsters are also certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (though the council confirms the Woolworths supply is not).  So you can enjoy your cut-price luxury seafood in clear conscience, unless the chain of events that led to them being proffered in the first place is enough to dull your appetite.    Updated at 6.37am GMT     6.05am GMT       The University of Tasmania has admitted its \u201cprocesses did not protect people\u201d, after releasing a review into its sexual harassment policies.  The review was sparked after its former vice-chancellor, Prof Peter Rathjen, was found to have engaged in \u201cserious misconduct\u201d with two female staff members while he was the vice-chancellor of the University of Adelaide.  South Australia\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption made that finding earlier this year in August. After that, the University of Tasmania launched a review of its processes during the period that Rathjen was VC in Tasmania, from 2011 to 2017. The barrister Maree Norton reviewed 11 complaints, three of which related directly to Rathjen. The UTAS review did not formally investigate individual complaints but rather was focused on the university\u2019s \u201chandling of issues that arose at the time\u201d. The current chancellor, Michael Field, today apologised and the university\u2019s council also issued a formal apology to \u201cvictims and survivors from the period\u201d. \u201cThis review has highlighted that as an institution we failed in these responsibilities,\u201d Field said. \u201cOur systems and processes in place at the time were not effective in protecting people.\u201d The university\u2019s chief people officer, Jill Bye, stressed that the review was \u201cnot a formal investigation into individual complaints\u201d. \u201cThis was an investigation into the university and its handling of issues that arose at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis review makes clear that our systems were not sufficient and that we did not have clear processes in place, and people were let down.\u201d     Updated at 6.49am GMT     5.46am GMT       Western Australia\u2019s premier, Mark McGowan, has been taking part in the national cabinet meetings remotely because he doesn\u2019t want to mix with South Australia\u2019s premier, Steven Marshall. It\u2019s not personal, but his state\u2019s Covid-19 rules mean mixing with South Australians is a no no.

He\u2019s doing that thing where he says he isn\u2019t criticising the government while obviously criticising the government.   It is disappointing news the UQ vaccine is not going to make the grade. There was a lot of store put in the University of Queensland vaccine. But no vaccine can or should be rolled out in Australia unless authorities are 100% sure and this decision gives Australians the confidence they need in the TGA or other authorities. Having said that, it also underlines what Labor has been saying \u2013 we need to ensure as many vaccine deals as possible for Australia. The UQ vaccine was the biggest part of the national strategy with 50m vaccines on order. Australia has had four vaccine deals in place, now we have three. As I\u2019ve constantly pointed out, international best practice is five or six ... So we\u2019ve given bipartisan support for every vaccine deal the government has entered into. We don\u2019t hold it against them the UQ failed, but we will call for more. Australians deserve the most possible as access.     Updated at 5.20am GMT     5.10am GMT       Prof Sharon Lewin from the Doherty Institute has just been on the ABC speaking about the University of Queensland Covid-19 vaccine.  She says it was the right decision to scrap the vaccine, and dismisses a question about whether the call was influenced by \u201cstigma\u201d around HIV.  This is a public health decision. We need really strong public health to vaccinate against Covid but also to test the blood supply and test people at high rates who may be at risk of HIV. Once you have something like this that\u2019s a false positive in a vaccine that could be potentially given to millions of people it will greatly complicate our public health response to HIV. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to stigma. We possibly could cope with it in Australia but in a low-income country this we be very, very difficult.     Updated at 5.19am GMT     4.51am GMT       The cost of Melbourne\u2019s Metro tunnel has blown out by $2.74bn, with the Victorian government relying on half to come from taxpayers, AAP reports. The extra money adds to the $11bn the state government has already committed for the major inner-city rail project. The transport minister, Jacinta Allan, on Friday revealed the Metro tunnel building consortium sent a letter on Thursday night agreeing in principle to equally share the cost to finish the project by 2025. Rail Projects Victoria received a letter from the group of contractors comprised of construction giants John Holland, Lendlease and Bouygues, bringing to an end a dispute with the government over deadlines and cost that has been threatening to delay completion. Allan said the government and the consortium had agreed to invest $1.37bn each, giving certainty to completion in 2025 \u2013 maybe even 2024 if all goes well. \u201cYes, there is additional investment required ... we\u2019re doing this because this is such an important project for the Victorian community,\u201d she said.    Updated at 4.56am GMT     4.19am GMT    Parliamentary committee recommends voter ID laws    Hello Guardian readers! It\u2019s a Friday afternoon in December, a time universally recognised as the peak period for news. In that spirit, I\u2019ll get straight into it. A little earlier today the federal parliament\u2019s joint standing committee on electoral matters released a 228-page report recommending Australia adopt voter identification laws and optional preferencing at elections. The report, chaired by the Liberal senator James McGrath, investigates if electoral reforms are needed in Australia, but the voter identification recommendation is hugely controversial and was quickly attacked by a number of groups.  The Human Rights Law Centre released a statement saying the proposals would weaken the fairness and equality of Australian elections. \u201cIntroducing voter ID laws ... would create a further barrier to voting by Australia\u2019s most disenfranchised populations, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\u201d the centre said in a statement on Friday. \u201cEnding compulsory preferential voting (would) potentially lead to millions of voters not having a say in who gets elected to parliament.\u201d Voter identification laws are a particularly vexed issue in the US. The American Civil Liberties Union says they disproportionately disenfranchise low-income, racial and ethnic minorities, the elderly, and people with disabilities. They also call them \u201ca solution in search of a problem\u201d. The parliament\u2019s report said the type of ID to be used in elections should be broad enough so as not to actively prevent people from voting and should include such things as a Medicare card, driver\u2019s licence, senior\u2019s card or a power bill. Exceptions could be made for itinerant and remote Indigenous voters, and in the case of someone being unable to provide ID, they could lodge a \u2018declaration\u2019 vote, the committee said.    Updated at 4.48am GMT     4.03am GMT       And with that, my time on this blog comes to an end.

With a street value of $1.8m, the methamphetamine was found in the three seperate packages that were in cargo assignment in Melbourne, leading to the arrest of a 26-year-old man in Adelaide.  He has been charged with trafficking a large commercial quantity of a controlled drug and bailed to appear in Adelaide magistrates court in May. Detective Chief Inspector Darren Fielke said the Covid-19 border restrictions and issues with international freight had not deterred alleged drug dealers. \u201cCriminals have been adapting to the changed circumstances,\u201d he said. But he said law enforcement agencies remained agile and were working closely to stay one step ahead.

Updated at 3.11am GMT     2.58am GMT       New South Wales is set for another weekend of wild weather, with a flood watch being issued for parts of the coast.  The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting heavy rainfall to hit places along the mid-north coast, which copped close to 100mm of rain overnight. A coastal trough is causing the chaos, and will enter south-east Queensland late on Saturday, before strengthening and returning to NSW on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re at quite a high part of the tidal cycle so (with) those waves in combination with the high tides, we\u2019re looking at potentially some inundation of some low-lying areas and potentially some coastal erosion up in the north,\u201d the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Jane Golding told reporters at a press conference today. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re closely watching the catchments between the Tweed and the Hastings, so that\u2019s from the Queensland border down to around about Port Macquarie.\u201d The NSW State Emergency Service has briefed and allocated extra volunteers to the region to deal with the weather. \u201cWe\u2019ve deployed some extra volunteers to those locations including flood rescue technicians,\u201d the SES chief superintendent, Greg Swindells, said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting we will see a lot of people in orange uniforms out and about helping the communities in which they live.\u201d    Updated at 3.03am GMT     2.44am GMT       Some more good news, this time from the federal minister for health:     Advice just received from the National Incident Centre - today marks the first 7 day period without any cases of community transmission since Feb 29.Many thanks to all Australians and take care.&mdash; Greg Hunt (@GregHuntMP) December 11, 2020      Updated at 2.52am GMT     2.34am GMT       5G data plans may eventually become so cheap as to provide competition to NBN plans.  That\u2019s according to ACCC\u2019s annual Communications Market Report, which showed that mobile plan prices fell by 17% in 2019-20, whilst NBN plans only fell by 2%.  \u201cThe growth in data allowances for mobile services means consumers received better value from their mobile plans,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. \u201cWhether this trend continues into 2021 will depend on how strongly mobile operators compete for new customers.\u201d The ACCC noted that while 5G is still in its infancy in Australia, operators are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and roll out. The technology could bring huge jumps in internet speed and lower latency, and could prove a more viable option to the NBN in the future.        2.15am GMT       The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the government plans to push ahead with legislation that would transfer environmental approval powers to state and territory governments and that this can occur without first taking steps to strengthen environmental protections. Morrison said state and territory governments had agreed at today\u2019s national cabinet meeting that streamlining of environmental bureaucracy was the \u201cfirst priority\u201d when it came to what the government has dubbed regulatory \u201ccongestion busting\u201d. The government has been trying to pass a bill that would clear the way for states and territories to take responsibility for decision making under national environmental law. It has been blocked by Labor, the Greens and crossbench senators who say the government has withheld key information about its bill and because legislation for strong national environmental standards was not presented to the parliament at the same time. Senators had also called on the government to delay its bill until after the release of the final report from the once-in-a-decade review of the act, which has been led by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel. Samuel recommended in his interim report that transfer of powers to states occur under a new framework of clear, national environmental standards and with enforcement and oversight from an independent regulator. Now Morrison used the word \u201cstandards\u201d a lot on Friday, making reference to \u201cexisting standards\u201d in the \u201cexisting laws\u201d, which he said would not change. We are checking precisely what was meant by that as it\u2019s not clear.  But what he did say was the government did not need to respond to Samuel\u2019s recommendations before passing its environmental streamlining bill: \u201cA second phase, after we are able to legislate those arrangements, is to take into account the recommendations of the Samuel review that may make recommendations on improvements and changes more broadly but we do not have to solve that problem in order to solve the first problem which is making things go faster.\u201d \u201cThat problem\u201d is presumably the massive failures by successive governments to protect Australia\u2019s environment, as identified in Samuel\u2019s interim report back in July and also by the national audit office in a separate report published in June. Samuel\u2019s interim report found Australia\u2019s environment was in unsustainable decline and laws meant to protect unique species and habitats had been ineffective.    Updated at 2.15am GMT     2.04am GMT       And now I\u2019d like to present to you some choice shots from the national cabinet presser, courtesy of our Mike Bowers:             Updated at 2.22am GMT     1.58am GMT       In different news, Rockhampton will vote for a new mayor in January after the Queensland government changed laws to prevent anti-mining and climate activist Chris \u201cPineapple\u201d Hooper from accepting the role. AAP has the story:  \u201cThe state government passed retroactive laws earlier this month to force a by-election in the central Queensland city following the resignation of mayor Margaret Strelow over misconduct. Mr Hooper was in line so succeed her as runner-up in the March mayoral election under laws passed by the state government in June. He tried to assume the role but Rockhampton Council delayed their regular meetings until the retrospective laws were passed, which stopped him from being sworn-in. The Electoral Commission of Queensland has announced a mayoral by-election will now be held in the city on January 23. On that day there will also be a by-election to fill new state Labor MP Les Walker\u2019s position as a councillor in Townsville. The Labor government admitted that it initially designed the automatic succession laws to deter popular councillors from running for state parliament. But the law didn\u2019t prove effective with a number of councillors running in the October state election. Ms Strelow resigned in November after the Councillor Conduct Tribunal found her guilty of misconduct over her failure to declare a $1600 trip to an Adani solar plant in Mumbai in 2017. She and Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill later announced their councils would fund a $30 million airport for the company\u2019s Carmichael coalmine in central Queensland. Adani Australia changed its name to Bravus Resources last month.\u201d You can read more on \u2018Pineapple\u2019 Hooper here:    Related: 'Pineapple' Hooper: could Rockhampton's unlikely mayoral candidate actually win?

We have been provided with expert advice on health and on the economy.\u201d    Updated at 1.55am GMT     1.21am GMT       In response to a question on why Australia isn\u2019t purchasing more of the Pfizer vaccine, which has recieved approval in the UK and the US, the PM has said the vaccine will be approved on \u201cAustralian rules with Australian officials and on the Australian timetable\u201d.  We want to ensure that Australians, and I think all of us feel very strongly this way, have full confidence, absolute full confidence that when it gets the tech they can get the jab. And they can make that decision for themselves and for their families confidently. So we are aware of what is happening in other states, in other nations around the world. We have a front row seat, frankly, as they go through that. And we will work through any potential issues that may arise in the data sharing arrangements we have, particularly with the United Kingdom, will be very instructive, I think, as they are the first want to go around the block on this full but there is a difference between what is happening here in Australia and what\u2019s happening overseas.     Updated at 1.24am GMT     1.17am GMT       The PM has said there are another 38, 655 stranded Australians overseas, with most being stuck in India and the UK. He said the government is monitoring the situation and is remaining in contact with those who have registered to return home.        1.16am GMT       NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has backed the PM in saying the focus of hotel quarantine programs should be focused on returning Australians, and that their capacity won\u2019t grow until next year:  \u201cI would like to have a conversation next year not just about international students were skilled migrants. The priority is to reduce the list of Aussies coming back home. I support the PM in that.\u201d       1.12am GMT       The PM has laughed off a question asking if Western Australian premier Mark McGowan not attending in person was disrespectful:  \u201cWe understand every state and territory has its rules and those rules need to be held up to and so we understand, but we obviously miss our colleague and look forward to him joining us next year.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to get Australian Open by Christmas and we are going to achieve that, I believe. And that has been made possible, I think, by the patient is a steady work of everyone you see here in front of you and I think that should be a great encouragement to Australians.\u201d       1.10am GMT       Victorian premier Dan Andrews has chimed in at this point, saying he hopes Victoria\u2019s quarantine capacity will look to lift its capacity in the coming weeks and months:  \u201cThat has got to be done safely and I think we will get to the end of the summer and we will certainly be processing more people. I think significantly more people than we are now. That has just got to be done in a steady way.\u201d    Updated at 1.55am GMT     1.08am GMT       The first question from reporters asks if Australia\u2019s international borders will be relaxed:  \u201cOur first priority is Australians and Australians returning home and I want to thank all the premiers and chief justice for the work they have done. Particularly NSW because they carry half the burden for the country and they are not all NSW Australians returning but from all across the country find themselves coming through NSW.  Victoria has begun again and the premier and I are looking forward to see that uplift in the New Year as we work through the capacity and have it fully functioning again in Victoria.  Queensland and WA both under that capacity and this is a very productive working relationship but what we all understand is, there are physical limitations on the hotel quarantine capacity but that is the safest and most effective way for people to come home and quarantine.  We all agree that the health standards on quarantine is the most important issue. Where we can create capacity for people to return residents, not Australian citizens, such as seasonal workers -- to return particularly with on-farm quarantine which provides capacity to see those economic needs met. But the first priority is the quarantine capacity for returning Australians and residents and that will continue to be our focus. Where we can create additional net capacity above and beyond that that doesn\u2019t prevent an Australian returning to the country, well, we remain very open to that.\u201d       1.04am GMT       Next the PM announced the commonwealth will lift the threshold for infrastructure support from $100 million to $250 million:   This will free up infrastructure Australia to focus more on the big projects and de-clog the process of getting these projects moving sooner.     Updated at 1.10am GMT     1.00am GMT       The PM continued, announcing a partnership between the commonwealth and the states and territories to top up \u201cexisting commitments to vocational education and training\u201d.  It is a big partnership, a billion-dollar partnership. We agreed on the economic front today about the progress of the job trainer program now operational in all states and territories except for the NT and that will be very soon implemented in the NT and this is a game changer in particular for young people but all people of all ages changing careers.     Updated at 1.10am GMT     12.58am GMT       The PM has announced the states, territories and commonwealth have agreed on a bilateral agreement on seasonal workers:  \u201cThere are different circumstances on the ground and different capabilities and capacities. In Queensland, for example, there has been a very, very successful on-farm quarantine seasonal workers program under way and it has been supporting the Queensland agriculture sector and primary producers but now we want to ensure that we can move to other arrangements in states and territories where that need is critical.\u201d  \u201cPremier Andrews I know it is a very important issue in Victoria presently as it is in many other states and we have agreed that bilateral arrangements made on health orders that will be applied to seasonal workers coming into states and that will unlock the ability for the Commonwealth to then provide seasonal worker visas which will confine those seasonal workers in those jurisdictions so they remain completely under the health control of those states and territories and that will be result in the bilateral arrangements that exist between the state and territories and the Commonwealth.\u201d       12.55am GMT       PM Scott Morrison says the states and territories are working on any \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in their plans to ensure the virus remains relatively contained.  We need to tighten some arrangements particularly around aircrew as well as on diplomats. These are the vulnerabilities. They are not on a grander scale but they are important vulnerabilities and as our success continues, the states and territories become even more razor-like focus on the areas where potential vulnerabilities can emerge and so we have had good discussions on how we can tighten arrangements in both those areas, working both bilaterally with the commonwealth as well as together.     Updated at 1.00am GMT     12.48am GMT       The PM is about to speak following the meeting of the national cabinet, and we are on standby to bring you everything discussed.     Updated at 1.00am GMT     12.47am GMT       The ABC has released an internal review that apparently found the national broadcaster didn\u2019t have enough \u201cconservative voices\u201d during their 2019 election coverage.  The review, undertaken by journalist and former adviser to the BBC Kerry Blackburn, raised concerns on the \u201cnarrow ... range of viewpoints\u201d presented on news discussion programs The Drum and Insiders. The report says that \u201cmore conservative voices and perspectives should have been included\u201d and that \u201cthe disparity impacted the program\u2019s impartiality\u201d. It comes after the Senate passed a motion forcing the ABC to release the report yesterday.  The broadcaster said it was \u201cproud\u201d of the representation on the show, and that it had worked to expand its pool of voices. \u201cThe pool of contributors on The Drum has continued to grow in political and geographic diversity and there have been changes to the pool of political journalists and expert commentators used on Insiders.\u201d The review didn\u2019t find any impartiality issues with the programs, with the statement saying the issues raised were \u201cminor.\u201d \u201cOverwhelmingly, this was outweighed by the evidence of thoughtful and impartial analysis and discussion produced by the program team across the election period.\u201d    Updated at 1.00am GMT     12.24am GMT       In better news for Victoria, another doughnut day:     Yesterday there were 0 new local cases, 0 new cases acquired overseas and 0 lost lives reported.

The state government planned to open registration for 40,000 vouchers at 10am on a \u201cfirst-come\u201d basis, but it appears people are unable to apply, with a white error message appearing if you hit the \u201capply now\u201d button.  Applicants will be able to claim back $200 on accommodation, tours or tickets if they spend more than $400 on a holiday in regional Victoria. The site appears to still be down after many technical experiments on my end (hitting it many times and refreshing the page), but I will update you all if it returns to functionality.        12.06am GMT       NSW has once again recorded no new locally acquired cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours.  Nine cases were reported in overseas travellers, however, bringing the total number of cases in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic to 4,444.    NSW recorded no new locally acquired cases of #COVID19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.Nine cases were reported in overseas travellers. This brings the total number of cases in NSW since the start of the pandemic to 4,444. pic.twitter.com/3OqDl4RPj2&mdash; NSW Health (@NSWHealth) December 11, 2020    None of the 80 active cases in the state are in intensive care, thankfully.        12.03am GMT       Good morning and happy Friday everyone, and a quick thanks to Calla for guiding us through a busy morning, a stellar job as always. I\u2019ll be taking you through this afternoon\u2019s stories, so let\u2019s dive in.     Updated at 12.13am GMT     12.01am GMT       Today marks nine months since the World Health Organisation declared the Covid-19 pandemic.  It feels longer.  I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for joining us on the live blog day after day. Your emails, tweets, and comments are always appreciated, even \u2014 especially! \u2014 when you point out errors and things we may have missed. This community of readers is a very special thing. Thank your for coming along for the ride. With that, I\u2019ll place you in the capable hands of Mostafa Rachwani who will take you through the day.        11.57pm GMT       Other things to note, as we speed towards national cabinet:  Queensland will enter the New Zealand travel bubble from Saturday. From 1am, NZers will not have to quarantine upon arrival.  The $200 Victorian travel vouchers, which can be spent when a Victorian spends at least $400 on accomodation somewhere in regional Victoria, have been released and the website where you can sign up for the vouchers has crashed.   We\u2019ll bring you more detail on both as the day goes on.       11.46pm GMT    Shares in biotech company CSL fall 2.6% after vaccine trial halted    CSL shares have fallen 2.6% this morning after the company cancelled trials of its potential Covid-19 vaccine and the Australian government cancelled its order for the drug. It is unlikely the ASX will haul CSL over the coals over the timing of its announcement to the market this morning. Listed companies are supposed to immediately tell the exchange of information that might materially affect their share price. In CSL\u2019s case, it reportedly told the government of problems with the vaccine trial on Monday and the government cancelled the deal on Thursday. But there\u2019s a disclosure carve-out for material that\u2019s confidential and it appears the information didn\u2019t leak until media reports this morning, outside of trading hours.The company then made a formal announcement before the market opened, so no one was able to trade on the reports. A quick eyeball of trading data over the past week shows a modest spike in volume on Wednesday, but it isn\u2019t outside the usual range for CSL shares. And there\u2019s been no big price movement either. Whether or not there\u2019s been any insider trading is a different question - and one for a different entity, the corporate regulator. Guardian Australia has contacted the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for comment.    Updated at 11.50pm GMT     11.45pm GMT       Anglicare has called on the Victorian government to give young people a break from fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions. The Victorian government says it plans to chase down more than $3m in unpaid fines issued to teenagers during the lockdown. That\u2019s disappointing, says Anglicare CEO Paul McDonald. He says young people have borne the brunt of the shutdown \u2014 being unable to attend school and university, isolated from friends, and disproportionately affected in job losses from the shutdown of the hospitality and retail industries.  Young people need to be shown some empathy during this seriously challenging year, as they\u2019re already suffering the effects of living through this pandemic. During lockdown, significant behaviour change was required for all of us, and particularly for young people. Behaviour change with some young people takes time. For the vulnerable young people in Anglicare Victoria\u2019s care, these kids have their own daily struggles with family violence or the youth justice system. They want to do the right thing, but it can take time to get the message through.  McDonald said most of the 2,000 fines issued to teenagers under the Covid-19 rules should have been a warning.  Premier Daniel Andrews showed remarkable leadership in managing that state out of the worst of the pandemic. I now urge the Victorian government to waive the fines for these young people and their families. It will go a long way towards helping these kids start the new year on a positive note.         11.37pm GMT    There is no coordinated foreign interference campaign targeting Australia, agencies say    Government agencies have not identified a \u201ccoordinated government campaign in foreign interference\u201d targeting Australia through social media, a Senate committee has been told. The comments were made on Friday at a hearings for a Senate select committee examining the issue. Neil Hawkins, of the Department of Home Affairs, told the hearing there had not been a \u201cco-ordinated government campaign in foreign interference [through social media] targeting Australia\u201d.\u201cThe area where we are most concerned about is our elections, we saw what happened in 2016 in the US and 2017 in France,\u201d he said.  He said officials had set up \u201ccapability\u201d to deal with the potential threat, including at state and territory elections, but no co-ordinated \u201cclandestine\u201d campaign has been uncovered.  \u201cA lot of this disinformation has nothing to do with governments,\u201d he said. Later, officials also confirmed social media platforms operating in Australia have no legal obligation to report foreign interference they identify. Jenny McAllister, a Labor senator, told officials the committee had previously heard from the Chinese-owned platform TikTok that it was unclear to which Australian government agency companies should report foreign interference activities. McAllister was concerned none of the agencies had directly engaged with the platforms to tell them what to do if they uncovered foreign interference targeting Australia.  Hawkins noted the electoral commission had made its expectations clear during the last election campaign, but the hearing was told that otherwise discussions between government agencies and the platforms had been more focused on counter-terrorism.  Dfat officials confirmed the government had successfully asked a social media platform to remove material that used Australian government logos to try to \u201ccultivate the impression that there was an official Australian government criticism\u201d of Vanuatu. It was related to allegations of Indonesian troll farms combating the West Papuan independence movement. Officials also said that though it was damaging disinformation, there was no evidence that the anti-vax movement was linked to foreign interference.    Updated at 11.45pm GMT     11.28pm GMT       The NSW government has rejected a recommendation to create an independent office of animal protection. The recommendation was made by a parliamentary inquiry into animal cruelty laws in NSW, chaired by Animal Justice Party MP Mark Pearson. Adam Marshall, the NSW agriculture minister, said in a response to the inquiry that the government did not support recommendation to remove responsibility for the protection of animal welfare out of the department of primary industries. Also not supported was a recommendation to conduct a one-day public hearing in which animal charities like RSPCA would have the opportunity to give evidence about animal cruelty matters; to establish and fully fund a specialist unit within NSW Police to investigate animal cruelty offences; and to establish and fully fund an independent statutory body, the independent office of animal protection. Pearson said the decision to reject the recommendation would \u201cimpact millions of animals\u201d. He said:  The RSPCA currently successfully prosecutes less than 1% of complaints they receive, and that tells you everything you need to know about the effectiveness of having under-resourced charities enforce animal cruelty laws.        11.06pm GMT       While we\u2019re talking about former politicians, former PM Malcolm Turnbull and his art curtain have appeared on BBC Question Time, which is Q+A with accents. He was commenting on Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion that the UK may end up with an \u201cAustralian-style deal\u201d with the European Union. Which is a short way of saying no deal at all, just some ad-hoc agreements. Says Turnbull:   We have obviously a deal with the EU on WTO terms and there are really some very large barriers to Australian trade with Europe which we\u2019re seeking to address as we negotiate a free trade agreement with Europe.  But Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one. It\u2019s our third biggest trading partner collectively because it\u2019s such a big economy. but there are very big barriers to Australian exports of agricultural products in particular. There\u2019s a lot of friction in the system in terms of services ... be careful what you wish for. Australia\u2019s relationship with the EU is not one from a trade point of view that I think Britain would want, frankly.      \u201cBe careful what you wish for.

Apparently they discussed Australia\u2019s \u201cambitious climate action agenda\u201d. That must have been a short briefing.     I was pleased to join @VickiTreadell for breakfast this morning at Westminster House.An enjoyable discussion which included, among other topics, a briefing on Australia\u2019s ambitious climate action agenda. pic.twitter.com/8q6ztKSDW5&mdash; George Brandis (@AusHCUK) December 10, 2020         10.54pm GMT       Back at the University of Queensland and CSL briefing in Australia, Prof Trent Munro, UQ\u2019s senior group leader at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, said the decision to halt the development of the Australian vaccine candidate was a \u201cparticularly disappointing day for the team\u201d.   The team is devastated.  The fact was that the data looked so promising, he said. The HIV immune response was a risk, but unexpected, he added, reiterating that there was no risk to participants of actually having HIV. Munro said:  We were anticipating that there may be an issue which is why we included this in this in the original consent forms for our vaccination. But we weren\u2019t expecting the vaccines would would respond with this low level [HIV immune] response. That was the unexpected finding.  The researchers said it would take 12 months to redesign the vaccine. It would therefore not make sense to produce it for this particular pandemic. But if Covid-19 continues to be an issue, the team may look at developing it down the track.    Updated at 11.04pm GMT     10.50pm GMT    FDA advisory panel recommends approval of Pfizer Covid vaccine for emergency use    In other vaccine news, an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended the emergency approval of the Pfizer and BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.  More from Jessica Glenza at Guardian US:   If the FDA grants emergency approval, the US would be the third country in the world to have authorized the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the broader public behind the UK and Canada, and it will be the most populous country to do so. In more data on the vaccine released in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, Pfizer and BioNTech said the vaccine was 95% effective in a randomized controlled trial of more than 43,000 people. An accompanying editorial in the journal described the vaccine\u2019s development as a \u2018triumph\u2019 for science. The vaccine uses messenger RNA technology to introduce the body to the spike protein found on the outside of the coronavirus to provoke an immune response. It requires two doses, administered three weeks apart. Scientists are still studying how long the vaccine will protect people, the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children and pregnant women, and the rate of asymptomatic disease in vaccine recipients. The FDA could approve the vaccine for emergency use at any time after the advisory committee meeting, and the Trump administration is pushing for speedy approval. But the FDA must signal it is giving safety and efficacy concerns due consideration. Vaccines in general have a higher bar for approval than many medicines, because they are given to healthy adults. Approving a vaccine too quickly could stoke public skepticism, and lead to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. Too slow an approval puts more lives at risk. More than 2,000 Americans per day and 80 Americans per hour are killed by the virus. The FDA takes the actions recommended by its advisory panels about 78% of the time, according to a recent study by the Milbank Quarterly.

Updated at 10.55pm GMT     10.36pm GMT       A bit more on how the false-positive HIV test result was returned in some participants in the University of Queensland and CSL trial. The Covid-19 spike protein has been the focus of this vaccine. The University of Queensland\u2019s molecular clamp technology locks the \u201cspike\u201d protein into a shape which allows the immune system to be able to recognise and then neutralise the virus. Covid\u2019s spike proteins, like most surface viral proteins, are fairly unstable. To ensure that the vaccine induces the right immune response, the vaccine needs to lock that shape into place, or in other words make it stable. That was achieved with the molecular clamp technology. The clamp chosen comprises two fragments of a protein found in HIV on its own, as those fragments provided the greatest stability. It is completely harmless adding that protein to the spike protein, while also providing that greatly enhanced stability. Trial participants were advised of the possibility that vaccine-induced HIV antibodies might be detected. Subsequent HIV tests provided definitive negative results.    Updated at 10.55pm GMT     10.35pm GMT    Pacific Island Forum leaders say Covid-19 should not be an excuse for inaction on climate change    The Pacific Island Forum leaders have issued a statement saying that Covid-19 is not an excuse for delaying urgent action on climate change. The forum is holding a roundtable on urgent climate change action tonight, Fiji time, to mark five years of the Paris Agreement.  Pacific Forum Chair, Tuvalu prime minister Kausea Natano, said:  We are already facing the reality of climate change even at the current level of 1.2 degree Celsius. Greenhouse gas emissions have reached record levels and are rising. If we do not act now, many of our low-lying atoll islands will be uninhabitable within our lifetimes. We have no time to lose  As the Blue Pacific continent, the Kainaki II Declaration is our call on humanity to reset and take immediate and decisive climate change action. Pacific Islands Forum secretary general, Dame Meg Taylor, said the world has \u201cgone past the tipping point and the science is showing that urgent and decisive action is what we need to come back from the brink\u201d. She said the coronavirus pandemic \u201cmust not be an excuse for inaction\u201d.   Rather, the Pacific sees the pandemic as a catalyst for greater climate change ambition, more urgent action, and building back better. This generation of world leaders, of business leaders, of citizens, has the opportunity to make the necessary policy and behavioural change. The science is clear. Our leaders are clear. We must all act, and act now.  Small Pacific Island nations contribute much less than 1% of global C02 emissions. Australia has the highest emissions of any of the Pacific Island Forum members.        10.16pm GMT       Meanwhile, shares in CSL are now shaping up to fall by more than 1% when trading starts at 10am. A drop of 1.13% is predicted, based on broker order books.  The company this morning told the market it won\u2019t be going ahead with further trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine and the government has cancelled an order for the drug.       10.15pm GMT       Dr Andrew Nash, CSL\u2019s chief scientific officer, said during a press briefing which is currently underway that, for months, University of Queensland and CSL researchers had been working around the clock on the vaccine. He said the vaccine was safe and effective, but the false positive HIV result would prove an issue for rollout, as it may erode public confidence and would require changes to existing and well-established HIV tests to ensure false positives due to the vaccine would not occur.Nash said:   Now from the very beginning of this project, we have highlighted that there is a risk of failure associated with early vaccine development. In summary, the study has shown that the vaccine elicits a robust neutralising response, and has good safety features. However, the University of Queensland research has found that the vaccine generated antibodies towards the GP-41 molecular clamp that are cross-reactive in some HIV tests, and which leads to a false positive result in those tests.  A molecular clamp is a polypeptide used to maintain the shape of proteins in vaccines. The University of Queensland vaccine is a protein vaccine, which means it includes harmless pieces of Covid-19. Once vaccinated, the immune system recognises that the proteins don\u2019t belong in the body and begins building antibodies.\u201cI want to emphasise that there is no adverse health implications for the clinical trials of the body, and there is no possibility that the vaccine causes HIV infection,\u201d Nash said. \u201cI also want to highlight through the study, no serious adverse effects or safety concerns were reported in the participants.\u201d    Updated at 10.16pm GMT     10.11pm GMT       Dr Andrew Nash, the chief scientific officer of CSL, said that there is no safety issue identified in the vaccine \u2013 it\u2019s just a diagnostic issue. He says:   I want to emphasise there\u2019s no adverse health reactions and there\u2019s no possibility the vaccine causes HIV infection. I want to highlight through the study no serious adverse events or safety concerns were reported in the 216 trial participants.  Now, over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve worked closely with experts in HIV and pathology to potential management solutions. In consultation with the Australian government, CSL and the University of Queensland have now concluded that while there is not a safety issue, there are a number of challenges in rolling out the vaccine and that these challenges might have an impact on public confidence in vaccination programs more broadly. At this stage, and without more data, significant changes would need to be made to the well established HIV testing procedures and the healthcare setting would need to change to accommodate the rollout of this vaccine. Therefore, CSL won\u2019t be proceeding with the further development of the program and the phase two and three study will not go ahead.  The phase-one trial will continue with scheduled follow-up and monitoring of participants and in due course the University of Queensland plans to submit full data for peer review publication.  Now, from the very beginning of this project, we have highlighted there\u2019s a risk of failure associated with early vaccine development. This decision emphasises the rigorous assessment involved in vaccine development and the myriad considerations that must be taken into account in order to produce a vaccine that\u2019s safe and effective, logistically viable and publicly acceptable. And while there\u2019s still many challenges along the way to produce a vaccine against Covid-19, we remain steadfastly committed to our work protecting the Australian population against this pandemic to.  This end, manufacture of approximately 30 million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine candidate is under way with first doses planned to be released for use in Australia early next year. In addition, CSL has now agreed at the request of the Australian government to manufacture an additional 21 million doses to ensure that there\u2019s enough of this vaccine, should it be approved by the regulators, to cover the entire Australian population. And on behalf of everybody at CSL, I like to acknowledge that we are very proud to be able to step up and make this additional commitment.     Updated at 10.16pm GMT     10.08pm GMT       The University of Queensland and CSL are holding a media briefing on the decision to abandon the trial. It\u2019s a webcast. There were 216 participants in phase 1 of the CSL/UQ clinical trial. The trial began on 13 July with 120 participants, five groups of 24, and all participats are healthy adults aged 18 to 55. Ninety-six participants received the accine, 24 received the placebo.  It was expanded on 15 September with an additional 96 participants, 72 of whom got the vaccine and 24 got a placebo.  Monitoring of those participants will continue.        9.57pm GMT       And now for some festive news, via AAP:  Almost $80 million worth of MDMA has been found inside an excavator imported to Australia from the United Kingdom, prompting the arrest of five men across both countries. Just under 450 kilograms of the drug - with an estimated street value of $79 million - was found inside the excavator. Federal police on Wednesday raided four locations across western Sydney, arresting two men and seizing about $1.2 million in cash. Another three men were arrested by authorities in the UK.        9.51pm GMT       Labor deputy leader Richard Marles was doorstopped about the UQ vaccine outside parliament this morning.  He said:  It is really important that the Government gives a very clear explanation of the decisions that it has made, the plan that it has going forward, so that it can maintain public confidence in the program of working on and ultimately allowing a vaccine for the Australian community because that\u2019s going to be very important. Vaccines matter. They deeply matter. This is obviously a big blow. But the role for Government today, is to make sure that they are inspiring confidence in the Australian people about the program of developing and ultimately rolling out a vaccine in this country.   A reporter asked Marles if he will get the vaccine when it becomes available.  Marles:  Oh, absolutely. I\u2019ll be taking all the medical advice. And I have confidence in our doctors, in our scientists to make sure that when the vaccine is publicly available, that\u2019ll be safe and I\u2019ll definitely be taking the vaccine.         9.47pm GMT       After dining with many of the premiers and chief ministers at the Lodge on Friday night after parliament rose for 2020, Scott Morrison will preside over the 32nd national cabinet meeting on Friday (but who\u2019s counting?). The national federation reform council (which replaces the old Coag) will also meet. If you want to understand these distinctions a little better, here\u2019s a primer. On the agenda for national cabinet:  An update on the economic outlook from Treasury secretary Stephen Kennedy. An update on the coronavirus including an epidemiological update, and reaching agreement about the vaccine roll-out.\u2022 Border management issues, including emergency management, and the three step reopening.Setting priorities for 2021  On the agenda for the national federation reform council:  Job creation. Commonwealth state system reforms. Mental health. Emergency management. Taskforce discussions (Indigenous, women\u2019s safety, veterans\u2019 wellbeing). A presentation from local government.        9.44pm GMT       Health minister Greg Hunt has issued a press release stressing the purchase of an additional 20 million units of the AstraZeneca vaccine. It also provided some more information about the false positives to HIV in the CSL/UQ vaccine:  The University of Queensland utilised a \u201cmolecular clamp\u201d vaccines design based on a highly promising technological platform, and has the potential be used to vaccinate against a number of potential viruses. As part of the vaccine\u2019s design, the university\u2019s researchers included a small fragment of a protein taken from the HIV virus, known as glycoprotein 41 (gp41). This has been used to create a \u201cmolecular clamp\u201d to hold the vaccine\u2019s synthetic virus in place.  Although the university\u2019s researchers have confirmed the protein fragment poses absolutely no health risk to people who have taken the vaccine, they have identified a partial antibody response to it among trial participants.  This has the potential to interfere with some HIV screening tests that look for these antibodies \u2013 leading to a false positive test result.  It is this impact on HIV screening \u2013 and in the context of other promising vaccine candidates becoming available \u2013 that has led to the Government\u2019s decision. The decision was based on the unanimous advice of SITAG.  Importantly, pathology testing that directly looks for the HIV virus has confirmed negative results for the trial participants who have taken the vaccine.  Participants were informed the protein formed part of the vaccine before they consented to taking part in the trial \u2013 and HIV screening tests were carried out before and after vaccination.  Participants will continue to be monitored to establish if the antibody response to the protein decreases over time.  The government will continue to support UQ is in its ongoing research due to this new platform providing such a promising breakthrough in vaccinations.     Updated at 9.52pm GMT     9.41pm GMT       It should be stressed the fact that we have any viable coronavirus vaccines just 12 months after the disease was first detected, let alone four that have completed or are in phase 3 trials with strong results, is remarkable. As Prof Nancy Baxter, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health told the ABC:  I think what\u2019s important to note is, if we were in a different position right now \u2013 if none of the other vaccines looked like they were going to work \u2013then having some false-positive HIV tests would have been something the world would have accepted as necessary to actually make people immune to Covid-19. People are not at risk of getting HIV from this vaccine \u2013 it\u2019s a protein, and the body is creating an antibody to that protein, so there\u2019s no risk to the individual.  But obviously if we have other great options for vaccines, then it doesn\u2019t make sense for people to have a false-positive HIV test. So that\u2019s why this has stopped. So we\u2019re really in a very fortunate position to have multiple vaccines that look like they\u2019re going to be effective.  However Baxter said Morrison had put a positive spin on Australia\u2019s vaccine position. The two vaccines closest to getting regulatory approval are the Pfizer vaccine, which Australia has secured 10m doses of, and Moderna, of which Australia has not secured any doses. AstraZeneca and Novovax are not quite so far along.    Updated at 11.12pm GMT     9.35pm GMT       Shares in CSL are set to fall when the market opens this morning after the company announced it was ditching plans to go ahead with testing of its Covid-19 vaccine and the government has cancelled its order for the drug. A fall of about 0.76% is predicted, based on broker order book data at around 8.30am, but this could change closer to the opening bell. ASX listed companies are required to immediately inform the market of any developments that might materially affect their share price. In CSL\u2019s case, the company reportedly told the government of problems with its trial on Monday, with the government moving to can its order on Thursday. There\u2019s no sign of an unusual bump in trade volumes this week but it\u2019s also not unusual for the corporate regulator to take a close look at trading in the lead-up to big announcements like this one.       9.32pm GMT    Australia has not been granted a speaking slot at the global climate summit    The UN has released a list of speakers this morning, in alphabetical order, and it skips from Austria to Bangladesh.  No Australia.     Despite lobbying hard, Brazil &amp; Australia appear to have missed the cut for Saturday&#39;s UN #climate ambition summit. Guess the clue was in the name. pic.twitter.com/GvADCfydzq&mdash; Ed King (@edking_I) December 10, 2020         9.30pm GMT       Morrison says that while it\u2019s disappointing to not continue the CSL/UQ trial, it\u2019s not a setback in terms of the Australian government\u2019s ability to get everyone vaccinated.  I think what this demonstrates is the effectiveness of our strategy. And what we can do is vaccinate our population twice over. And we have one of the highest ratios of availability of doses of any country in the world. So this isa demonstration of the success of the vaccination policy and approach that we have been following. We have prepared for this. We have planned for this. And now we\u2019re making decisions in accordance with this. And so I think this does demonstrate both the science that we have available in Australia, but also the manufacturing capability.  CSL is a leading manufacturer in the world. The minister and I have both visited the facility there, and I want to thank everyone down at the plant there because they\u2019re going to be busy, they\u2019re going to be producing those vaccines. As the minister said, the net outtake of this is we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later by the ability to bring this manufacturing capability forward. The process for manufacturing the molecular clamp vaccine are actually more complicated than it is for AstraZeneca. So this is basically adding on to the existing run, as opposed to a completely different manufacturing process. So that puts us in, I think, a strong position.  That stronger position is because all of CSL\u2019s manufacturing capability can now be focused on the AstraZeneca vaccine, rather than split between AstraZeneca and the molecular clamp vaccine.  Prof Brendan Murphy was asked how we know that the AstraZeneca, Novavax and Pfizer vaccines will not have similar problems. The short answer is that they have both moved to phase 3 clinical trials \u2013 AstraZeneca and Pfizer have released phase three data and Novavax is expected to release it soon \u2014 and no issue like this showed up.  So we\u2019re pretty confident that an issue like this is unlikely to happen because we\u2019ve got the Phase 3 data.  The Novavax platform is very different [to UQ]. It doesn\u2019t use the same molecular clamp \u2014 it uses a different approach. There\u2019s no reason why we would expect the same thing. And they\u2019ve published their Phase 1 studies, and they haven\u2019t realised any of these sort of issues... The AstraZeneca vaccine is more advanced in its development than UQ was, and because it\u2019s now in production, by making more of it, we can bring forward whole-of-population coverage with the AstraZeneca vaccine much earlier.  The Pfizer vaccine \u2014 the other one we have \u2014 it has also got Phase 3 trial information that the company has released. It\u2019s also gone through regulatory approval in, now, two countries, and a third coming up today. So it wouldn\u2019t have got through that if an issue like this had happened. So we\u2019re very confident we won\u2019t see this issue with the other vaccines. Novavax still has to publish Phase 3 trials, and we\u2019ll await those. But we know that Pfizer and AstraZeneca are in a very strong position.     Updated at 11.12pm GMT     9.22pm GMT       Morrison said that today\u2019s announcement should increase confidence in the vaccine process, because it shows that governments are willing to abandon the development of a vaccine that does not pass its tests.   I think today, and the decisions we\u2019ve taken, should give Australians great assurance that we are proceeding carefully, we are moving swiftly, but not with any undue haste here. At the end of the day, the Therapeutic Goods Administration \u2013 like with any vaccine in Australia \u2013 must have their tick-off. Without the tick, there\u2019s no jab when it comes to vaccines in this country.  He seemed pleased with that line, expect to hear that line repeated as we move toward a vaccine roll-out. He continued:  We\u2019ve all had vaccinations at various times in our lives. I have. My children have. And we take those vaccines in great confidence of the system that we have here in Australia. What you\u2019re seeing here is the system at work, protecting Australians, and making good decisions in the public health interest. So that\u2019s why we were so keen to keep Australians up to date here this morning \u2013 so you know where we\u2019re at. But the truth is, we\u2019re on track. The system\u2019s working as it should. And Australians are protected, as always.     Updated at 9.28pm GMT     9.18pm GMT       The secretary of the federal health department, Prof Brendan Murphy, said the CSL/UQ vaccine was \u201clikely to be a promising vaccine\u201d but the risk of an HIV false positive could undermine public confidence, so the trial was abandoned:  It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn\u2019t want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence, but it was a very, very good technology, it was looking like it was going to make antibodies, and it probably would have worked very well as a vaccine, but we can\u2019t have any issues with confidence, and we are \u2013 as a nation now, with a good portfolio of vaccines \u2013 able to make these decisions to best protect the Australian people.   The risk of a false positive to HIV was known from the outset. Murphy was asked why the Australian government decided to invest in the vaccine given this risk, and says that the high prevalence of false positives was unexpected:  I think the risk of actually getting a false-positive was seen to be extremely low at the outset. Everyone was very surprised at the unexpected prevalence of the false-positive. It\u2019s only a small portion of the HIV protein that\u2019s in the vaccine as the molecular clamp. The modelling at the time thought it was a very low theoretical risk on that basis \u2013 that\u2019s why people were informed of that risk. But it was very surprising to CSL and UQ the incidence of the false positives. So it was very unexpected.      Updated at 9.21pm GMT     9.14pm GMT       Greg Hunt says Australia now has one of the highest rates of vaccine purchases and availability to population in the world.  That\u2019s 53.8m AstraZeneca units, enough to cover the whole of the Australian population, 51m Novavax units, also enough to cover the whole of the population, 10m Pfizer units, and 2.5m units under the Covax facility. So, 140m units all up:  The net result of the decisions taken and the next evolution of the scientific advice is that we will have strengthened our position in two vaccines, and discontinued the process in relation to one vaccine which is, of course, the University of Queensland. The final outcome from all of that is that there is the potential for slightly earlier completion of the vaccine rollout for Australians in 2021. So that net result is a very important outcome for Australians.        Updated at 11.12pm GMT     9.10pm GMT    Australia increasing production of AstraZeneca virus to 53.8m doses and Novavax to 51m    Scott Morrison said that in accordance with the government\u2019s vaccine strategy, it has redeployed resources to deliver other vaccines:  And so we are increasing our production and purchase of AstraZeneca vaccines from 33.8m to 53.8m, and we\u2019re increasing our access to the Novavax vaccine from 40m to 51m. So that\u2019s an extra 20m doses of AstraZeneca, and an extra 11m doses of Novavax. The AstraZeneca vaccines, of course, are manufactured here in Melbourne by CSL.  Safety and health \u2013 that has always been the starting point for all of our responses when it comes to the Covid-19 pandemic. Having a clear plan. Getting clear advice. Making decisive decisions to ensure that we can put the health interests of Australians first. That lays the platform for the economic recovery that is undertaking right now as we end this year and go into 2021.   Morrison then threw to the health minister, Greg Hunt, who he says is \u201cone of the standout health ministers of the world in terms of how he has led our response and put Australia in such a strong position to be where we are as we go into this Christmas\u201d. So that\u2019s a nice Christmas card for Hunt.     Updated at 11.12pm GMT     9.06pm GMT       Morrison says the Australian government selected four vaccine candidates to back with federal funding earlier this year, never expecting that all four trials would result in a viable vaccine:  Our vaccine strategy, and our vaccine policy, had identified four vaccines that we believed \u2013 based on the scientific advice \u2013 had the potential to go through to the end of stage tree trials and be available here in Australia.  At no stage, can I assure you, that we believed that all four of those vaccines would likely get through that process. If that had occurred, that would have been truly extraordinary, based on the process of vaccine development not only in this country, but anywhere else. So that\u2019s why we spread our risk. That\u2019s why we backed important projects. And that\u2019s why we pre-prepared to ensure that we could deal with any issues along the way.  The advice that we have received, and the national security committee of cabinet met this week and made the final decision yesterday, is that the University of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part ofAustralia\u2019s vaccine plan.  I do want to thank, though, Prof Paul Young and all the team up there at University of Queensland for the amazing work that they have done in getting the vaccine to that stage. And we will continue to support and fund the work that they\u2019re doing on molecular clamp research on vaccines, which has application in many other areas. They\u2019re doing great work. They are amazing. I\u2019m incredibly proud of all of our scientists for the awesome work that they\u2019ve been doing to support us this year. And so I congratulate them and thank them for all the hard work they\u2019ve put in this year.     Updated at 9.13pm GMT     9.02pm GMT       Scott Morrison is speaking in Canberra now.    Updated at 9.12pm GMT     9.01pm GMT       Guardian Australia\u2019s Melissa Davey and Chris Knaus explained the molecular clamp technology at use in the CSL/University of Queensland vaccine trail in this article, back in October:  The process of infection relies on the virus using the spike proteins on its outer surface to attach on to human ACE2 receptors \u2013 a protein on the surface of many cells, including in organs and on tongues. Once attached, the spike transforms and unfolds, hooking into the cell and crashing the virus particle and cell together, forming a channel through which a string of viral genetic material can pass into the human cell. When the body\u2019s immune system fires up to combat the virus, much of its effort goes toward that spike protein. UQ has effectively taken the Covid-19 genetic sequence, isolated the section that codes for the spike protein, and changed that sequence to include a clamp that locks three spike proteins together in the form they exist in before they try to bind with human cells. The upshot? The body gets all the immune response with none of the infection and is vaccinated against future Covid-19 infection.  The phase one trials have proved that this kind of vaccine works even if this specific vaccine candidate will not be progressed, which is a pretty significant development.  You can read more on that here:   Related: The race for a Covid vaccine: inside the Australian lab working round the clock to produce 100m doses      Updated at 9.11pm GMT     8.56pm GMT       The statement to the ASX says analysis of the phase one data will continue, and the full data will be submitted to peer review. The vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland, Prof Deborah Terry, said she was proud of the UQ team despite the disappointing result:  I also want to thank our many partners, our donors \u2013 including the federal and Queensland government \u2013 and of course the 216 Queenslanders who so willingly volunteered for the phase 1 trials.  The co-lead researcher on the trial, Prof Paul Young, said it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine to remove the issue that caused the HIV false positives, but doing so would set development back 12 months, and \u201cthe urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone\u2019s priority\u201d:  I said at the start of the vaccine development, that there are no guarantees, but what is really encouraging is that the core technology approach we used has passed the major clinical test. It is a safe and well-tolerated vaccine, producing the strong virus neutralising effect that we were hoping to see. So we will continue to push forward and we are confident that with further work the molecular clamp technology will be a robust platform for further vaccine development here in Australia and to meet future biosecurity needs.   CSL is now working on making 30m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with the first doses to be released in Australia early next year. Full data from the AstraZeneca trials shows it has 70% efficacy.  Dr Andrew Nash, the chief scientific officer for CSL, said the Australian government had ordered another 20m doses of that vaccine.     Updated at 11.13pm GMT     8.45pm GMT    CSL says vaccine trials will not go head due to HIV false positives    CSL has issued an announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange confirming that the phase two and three clinical trials of the vaccine will not go ahead. The statement says that phase one trials of the UQ/CSL v451 Covid-19 vaccine showed a \u201crobust response towards the virus and has a strong safety profile\u201d.  But it said the trials will not go ahead because some participants in the phase one trial showed a false positive result for HIV. They explain:  The Phase 1 data showed the generation of antibodies directed towards the \u201cmolecular clap\u201d component of the vaccine. These antibodies interfere with certain HIV diagnostic assays. The potential for this cross-reaction had been anticipated prior to the commencement of the trial. Participants were fully informed prior to their involvement that this could occur. Blood samples from the study participants were tested after vaccination and it was found that these molecular clamp antibodies did cause a false positive on a range of HIV assays. Follow-up tests confirmed there was no HIV virus present, just a false positive on certain HIV tests. There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection.  The statement says the trial was halted because of the implications of that issue, if the vaccine were to be rolled out to broad populations:  It is generally agreed that significant changes would need to be made to well-established HIV testing procedures in the healthcare setting to accomodate rollout of this vaccine. Therefore, CSL and the Australian government have agreed vaccine development will not proceed to Phase 2/3 trials.     Updated at 9.08pm GMT     8.35pm GMT    Palaszczuk confirms vaccine trial has been 'abandoned'    Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has confirmed that the CSL/University of Queensland vaccine trials have been abandoned. She told ABC News breakfast that it was devastating news:  I think we\u2019re very, very disappointed but of course there\u2019s been a number of companies right throughout the world and universities teaming up to come up with a vaccine in such a short period of time. Of course we\u2019re disappointed and now all eyes are looking at what is happening in the UK with the rollout of their vaccine. And of course I think the Australian government and every leader at state and territory is watching closely the outcomes of what is happening in the UK.  She would not confirm why the trials were suspended, saying that would be a matter for the researchers:  I will leave that to the experts to talk about. I\u2019ve just been advised yesterday, late afternoon, that the trial has to be abandoned. But I will let the experts talk about that in more detail.

The deals promising onshore manufacture of the University of Oxford vaccine by AstraZeneca and the University of Queensland vaccine by CSL will be announced by Scott Morrison with the health minister, Greg Hunt, and the science minister, Karen Andrews, on Monday. The AstraZeneca deal could see 3.8m doses of the Oxford vaccine available as early as January and February 2021, with the UQ vaccine to follow in mid-2021. The University of Oxford vaccine has entered phase three trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and the US. It has generated strong immune responses and no significant safety concerns to date. The UQ vaccine is in pre-clinical testing, being used on 120 adults in Brisbane, and has shown promise in animal trials. Both vaccines are likely to require two doses per person \u2013 an initial dose and then a booster.   Related: Morrison walks back comments on potential Covid vaccine, saying 'it is not going to be compulsory'    More than 95% of the vaccine doses will be manufactured in Melbourne, an advance on the position in August when the CSL chief financial officer warned it was too early to say if Australian manufacture was possible. In a statement, the prime minister said: \u201cAustralians will gain free access to a Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 if trials prove successful.\u201d \u201cBy securing the production and supply agreements, Australians will be among the first in the world to receive a safe and effective vaccine, should it pass late-stage testing,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThere are no guarantees that these vaccines will prove successful, however the agreement puts Australia at the top of the queue if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light.\u201d In August, the Morrison government announced a heads of agreement with AstraZeneca, prompting criticism from the opposition that a formal agreement had not been signed. Labor said Australia was lagging well behind the US and UK. The announcement also caused confusion when Morrison was forced to clarify the vaccine would not be compulsory after earlier suggesting it would be \u201cas mandatory as you can possibly make\u201d.   Related: Covid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?

The Australian government would purchase 33.8m doses of the Oxford vaccine and 51m doses of the UQ vaccine. The Australian government has suggested it would also play a role in helping achieve early access to the vaccines for countries in the Pacific, as well as regional partners in south-east Asia.Both agreements allow for additional orders to be negotiated and for doses to be donated or on-sold (with no markup) to other countries or international organisations. If both vaccines are successful, Australia will have around 30 million spare doses.", "Australian government does deal to secure potential Oxford University Covid vaccine [2020-08-18T12:30:38Z]": "The Morrison government says it has reached an agreement with the British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to supply Australians with the University of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine for free \u2013 assuming it clears clinical trials. The vaccine agreement also includes a $24.7m contract with medical technology company Becton Dickinson for the supply of needles and syringes to make sure there is sufficient supply on hand to roll out the vaccine nationally. Scott Morrison says Australia has pursued the Oxford vaccine because it is \u201cone of the most advanced and promising in the world\u201d. But the prime minister says Australia will continue negotiations with other parties. \u201cThere is no guarantee that this, or any other, vaccine will be successful, which is why we are continuing our discussions with many parties around the world while backing our own researches at the same time to find a vaccine,\u201d Morrison said in a statement. The government proposes to sign a letter of intent with AstraZeneca and enter a consumables contract with Becton Dickinson for the supply of needles and syringes. The total cost of the program is likely to be in the billions of dollars. The government says the initial agreements will cover vaccine development, production and distribution, and it will contain a commitment to produce the vaccine locally. Subsequent agreements will include distribution, timing and the price of the vaccine.   Related: Australia lagging on contributions to global body funding Covid vaccine research    Australia\u2019s largest biotechnology company, CSL, has confirmed it is in discussions with AstraZeneca and the government concerning local production of the Oxford vaccine, as well as continuing work on another candidate under development at the University of Queensland. A statement from CSL said: \u201cDevelopment of the UQ vaccine candidate remains CSL\u2019s priority, however, we are currently in discussions with AstraZeneca and the Australian government to assess whether it is possible to provide local manufacturing support for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, should it prove successful, while protecting our commitment to the UQ vaccine. \u201cWe are assessing the viability of options ranging from the fill and finish of bulk product imported to Australia through to manufacture of the vaccine candidate under licence. There are a number of technical issues to work through and discussions are ongoing.\u201d With the government signalling over the weekend that a deal on a vaccine was close, Labor said Morrison should increase the funding available to Australian researchers. \u201cThere absolutely should be more commonwealth funding, and $5m to the University of Queensland is not enough when you consider that the government of Queensland is putting [in] $10m,\u201d the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said.

He had also previously been in the US where he worked at Cornell University. They were scheduled to leave the Chancellor from midnight on Tuesday and were packed and ready to depart.

Instead, they were told that they would not be released, and would have to spend another 14 days in quarantine.

Within a week the state would be in its second lockdown. \nThat same day Pfizer wrote to the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, with a clear sense of urgency, wanting to discuss a vaccination deal. \nAct fast, they hinted \u2013 other nations are signing deals. \n \n  Related: Scott Morrison insists \u2018every effort\u2019 was made to get vaccines, despite Greg Hunt missing Pfizer meeting  \n \nAlmost four months and hundreds of deaths later, Victoria\u2019s lockdown ended. Two more weeks after that, Australia finally signed the Pfizer contract. \nSeveral stumbles have hampered Australia\u2019s vaccination efforts. A local effort from the University of Queensland had to be dumped after false positive HIV results were found. Rare AstraZeneca side effects saw its use \u2013 and its popularity \u2013 curtailed. Moderna and Novavax are still on their way. \nPfizer has become the vaccine of choice, and there hasn\u2019t been enough. The UK signed up for 30m doses on 20 July.

If this was a race, did Australia fall at the first hurdle? \nA failure of public policy \nDocuments released under freedom of information legislation have started to unravel what a number of people have labelled the greatest public policy failure in Australian history. \nThe documents show the first discussion between Australia and Pfizer was on 26 June, and it was followed up by that 30 June email to the health department and an attached letter to health minister Greg Hunt. \nThe tone was clear. \u201cI am requesting this meeting at the earliest opportunity,\u201d the Pfizer representative wrote. The landscape is \u201cmoving swiftly\u201d, they said, adding that they were talking to other nations. Pfizer was moving urgently, so the vaccines could be \u201cdeployed at unprecedented speed\u201d. \nDespite the letter being addressed to Hunt, departmental first assistant secretary Lisa Schofield was dispatched. (A year later, both Morrison and Hunt came under fire for not meeting directly with Pfizer leadership \u2013 after former prime minister Kevin Rudd revealed that he himself had. Morrison deferred questions about the lack of meetings to Hunt, and when he was pursued over whether Hunt was right to demur, said: \u201cI\u2019ll let others make those judgments.\u201d) \nOther world leaders had direct contact with Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla \u2013 Bourla said Israel got the jump on vaccine orders in part because of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s persistence. \nGlobally Pfizer could have millions ready by the end of 2020, and hundreds of millions this year, the representative said in the released emails. Let\u2019s meet, they said. \nPfizer pushed, but Australia dithered. Why? \nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Pfizer was prioritising places where \u201cpeople were dying in their thousands, tens of thousands\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s where the focus of those companies was.\u201d \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \nBut Bourla said that wasn\u2019t how decisions were made. He told Fortune they had a system where high-income countries were charged \u201cthe cost of a meal\u201d, middle-income countries half that and low-income countries could buy at cost. He said in May or June 2020 they started negotiations with countries and eventually he was worried that poorer countries weren\u2019t signing up. \nHe had enough stock that he started calling people. \n\u201cWe were actually bothering them, \u2018come sign the contract, come sign the contract\u2019,\u201d he said. \nMorrison also said the government wanted to have a \u201chome-manufactured vaccine\u201d, with CSL making AstraZeneca in Melbourne, so as not to rely on overseas supplies. \nBut that doesn\u2019t explain why the government didn\u2019t set up a whole chain of fail-safes. \nGuardian Australia revealed that in August last year, while negotiations were languishing, the government\u2019s vaccine advisory group urged the health department to get as many vaccines as possible from different sources. \nGrattan Institute economist Stephen Duckett said Australia could have been \u201cfully vaccinated by February\u201d. Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at UNSW and a strategic health policy consultant, tweeted that it was \u201cno secret\u201d Pfizer offered deals to countries to secure priority access. \u201cSecuring supply required swift action and top-level connection to seal the deal. Not done. This failure delayed vaccine rollout by six months,\u201d he wrote. \n \n  Related: Pfizer asked to meet with Greg Hunt about \u2018millions of doses\u2019 of vaccine but was offered bureaucrat instead  \n \nMorrison derided \u201cheroes of hindsight\u201d, as he called them. \nDuckett says it was not a matter of hindsight, but lack of foresight. \n\u201cWhat most countries did was hedge their bets across a range of options. \n\u201cAustralia made a strategic decision not to hedge its bets.\u201d \nYou can\u2019t blame the government, he says, for what went wrong with the other vaccines. But you can blame them for ending up with only one option, and for lagging on that option. \n\u201cIf they\u2019d gone earlier they could have bought more. So they only got 10m, arriving late, whereas other countries went for options to get a lot, and by the time we got around to doing that, it was too late.\u201d \nMorrison said the government made \u201cevery effort\u201d to get more than 10m, but declined to say what those efforts comprised. When asked what efforts the government had made to get more, he said: \u201cEvery effort that we could.\u201d \n\u201cIn what way?\u201d \n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve answered the question,\u201d he said. \nNo sense of urgency \nThe question remains when every effort was made. The FOI documents obtained by Labor show that on 23 July, about a month after the initial contact, Pfizer wrote to Schofield pointing out that the UK and the US had already made agreements. \nThe email seems hopeful that a legal barney over a confidentiality agreement could be resolved. Before Pfizer could proceed with negotiations, they needed assurance that the information would not be shared. They needed a signed confidentiality disclosure agreement. An earlier email from Schofield had indicated that the government was \u201cconsidering\u201d the CDA, but was hesitant. \u201cIt is not usual practice for the commonwealth to sign such documents,\u201d she wrote. \nThe Pfizer representative indicates that lawyers are close to sorting it out, and asks for another meeting. That\u2019s it for the correspondence released. \nLabor\u2019s shadow health minister, Mark Butler, said the government was on a \u201cgo slow\u201d. \n\u201cIf we got in earlier how many more doses could we have got?\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a Rhodes scholar to conclude that if we\u2019d been in early we could have got more.\u201d \nPfizer said it needed approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration before it could deliver the vaccine. It got that on 24 January, and delivered the first doses on 15 February. On the TGA approval timeline, Morrison and Hunt both say other countries used emergency approval processes to speed up the rollout process, but Australia was taking a more \u201ccautious\u201d approach. \nPfizer said in a statement it proposed the initial batch of 10m doses, and pointed out the later agreements for another 30m doses. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cThe supply of vaccine in Australia was developed following consultation with the Australian government and each agreement was based on the availability of doses and earliest schedule that could be provided at that time,\u201d the statement said. \nAgain, it\u2019s unclear when it proposed the 10m doses, and whether it could have offered more if Australia had pushed sooner. \nAsked about the missing months, Morrison said there were more meetings, and more emails. \u201cOur political opponents have highlighted one set of correspondence, but there are many others,\u201d he said. \nUnfortunately, the government is keeping the correspondence that it says might vindicate it secret. \nAmid that secrecy, the idea that Australia was slow off the starting blocks has taken hold. Pfizer\u2019s former president of global research and development John LaMattina told the Guardian that securing just 10m doses was \u201cunconscionable\u201d and that every country should have reached out \u201cimmediately\u201d to place an order. \nHe told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 he understood Australia \u201ctook a pass\u201d on ordering any vaccines at the initial meeting and that if you want to get the attention of a global CEO, having the prime minister call is the way to do it. \nIt was Norman Swan, the ABC\u2019s coronavirus expert, who first broke the story about the troubles between the health department and Pfizer. He said that three separate sources told him an identical story about a rude departmental staff meeting with Pfizer and haggling over money and the intellectual property ownership. \nSwan thinks there was arrogance within the department, and no sense of urgency. \n \n  Related: Explainer: Is each state in Australia getting its fair share of Covid vaccine doses?  \n \n\u201cWe had the UQ vaccine, we had AstraZeneca, we didn\u2019t need this avaricious company pushing drugs on us,\u201d he told the Guardian. \nHe points out that about nine in 10 vaccines fail at the trial stage, so it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that there were so many options, but that Australia\u2019s four-vaccine strategy didn\u2019t build in enough insurance. \n\u201cI was not a critic of the four-vaccine strategy. At the time I thought that was OK,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t go for four vaccines. They went for three and a quarter vaccines.\u201d \nIn the wake of the documents\u2019 release, Morrison argues that Australia is catching up \u2013 that, for example, we are \u201conly a couple of weeks\u201d behind the US. He says his promise that the population would be fully vaccinated by October would be met because by mid-October enough vaccines will have arrived in the country. \nMorrison has abandoned his claim that the vaccine rollout \u201cis not a race\u201d, but regularly compares Australia\u2019s position on the track to others. \nThe problem with the race analogy is that while it\u2019s instructive to see how other countries perform, this race is not actually about beating other countries to the finish line. \nIt\u2019s about doing your personal best.", "Morrison says time between Pfizer doses to increase in NSW \u2013 as it happened [2021-07-23T08:48:48Z]": " \n  9.44am BST  \n What happened today, Friday 23 July \n  \n  And that\u2019s where we will leave things for the evening.

Lorna Jane Thinks So\u201d. \n  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched court action against Lorna Jane for allegedly making false and misleading claims. \n  In a decision delivered in the federal court on Friday, Justice Darryl Rangiah said Lorna Jane sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the deadly outbreak. \n  You can read more here: \n   \n    Related: Activewear brand Lorna Jane fined $5m for claiming clothes could stop Covid spread  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.22am BST \n \n \n  8.57am BST  \n  \n  Queensland has asked the Morrison government for an urgent meeting over their joint policy to protect the Great Barrier Reef, saying the state wants the finances and the plan finalised before February next year. \n  The 21-country world heritage committee is scheduled to make a decision in the next few hours on a recommendation from the UN\u2019s science and culture agency, Unesco, the reef be placed on the \u201cin danger\u201d list mainly because of impacts from climate change.  \n  Australia has lobbied fiercely to block the listing, with the environment minister, Sussan Ley, flying around Europe while Canberra-based ambassadors went on a snorkelling trip over the reef. \n  Whatever the decision, Australia is likely to formally request that Paris-based Unesco carries out a \u201creactive monitoring mission\u201d to the reef.  \n  In a letter to Scott Morrison seen by the Guardian, Queensland\u2019s deputy premier, Steven Miles, writes:  \n  \u201cTo prevent further industry and employment uncertainty, it is imperative this mission is not delayed and our ministers should meet as soon as possible to prepare for it.\u201d \n  Queensland wants to be able to report back to Unesco by 1 February 2022 with a revised version of its centrepiece Reef 2050 plan.  \n  That suggested date from Queensland is 10 months earlier than the Morrison government\u2019s preferred December 2022 deadline. \n  For a preview of what\u2019s coming tonight, here\u2019s our feature published earlier today.  \n  I\u2019ll be watching the decision as it plays out tonight. \n   \n    Related: Whether or not the Great Barrier Reef is listed as \u2018in danger\u2019 won\u2019t alter the fact it is at risk from climate change  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.07am BST \n \n \n  8.41am BST  \n  \n  NSW Health has updated its list of exposure sites. \n  New close contact venues/times are in Ultimo and Lakemba in Sydney, the Bunnings in Goulburn and a KFC on the Hume Highway in Marulan. \n  There are several venues for casual contacts in areas in Sydney including Liverpool, Ashfield, Dee Why, Fairfield and Greystanes.  \n  \n Updated at 9.03am BST \n \n \n  8.25am BST  \n  \n  Hi everyone, Lisa Cox here.  \n  The Australian Medical Association\u2019s president, Omar Khorshid, has called on the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) to review its advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine in response to the growing risks posed by the outbreak of the Delta variant in NSW. \n  The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, today declared the greater Sydney Covid-19 outbreak a national emergency, at the advice of the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant. \n  Khorshid said the standing Atagi advice on preferred application of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people 60 years of age and over was based on a risk assessment when there were low levels of community transmission. \n   \u201cThe situation in Sydney and NSW is today different to what it was a few days ago, with persistent and growing rates of community transmission of the Delta variant despite the lockdown. Today there were 136 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19,\u201d Khorshid said. \n   \u201cOf the new cases recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, more than 53 people were infectious in the community.  \n   \u201cIn this outbreak situation, Atagi must consider providing the community with much clearer and firmer advice on the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is used in many countries around the world and approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for anyone 18 years and over.\u201d \n  He said Sydney residents needed to be encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible as part of a new strategy to control the Delta outbreak.  \n   \u201cAs we don\u2019t have enough Pfizer to use in a targeted rollout, the only option is AstraZeneca. It will save lives and help see life return to some normality in greater Sydney. \n  \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where the risk of contracting Covid is substantial, as is the risk of the virus spreading outside the greater Sydney region.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 8.35am BST \n \n \n  8.13am BST  \n  \n  And that\u2019s it from me too. Here is the wonderful Lisa Cox to take you through the evening. \n  \n \n \n  8.06am BST  \n  \n  And that is it from prime minister Scott Morrison. The upshot is that basically NSW does not get the extra doses it said it needed earlier today, but there is a little tinkering with the gaps allowed between doses for both vaccines to assist with allocations. \n  \n \n \n  8.05am BST  \n  \n  The ABC just did its routine top of the hour voiceover which cut into the press conference while Morrison was answering a question about whether Pfizer should be offered to younger people.The question was about whether this advice should change given young people who were essential workers were spreading infections in NSW. \n  Couldn\u2019t catch all of his response, but basically he said NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian could change the arrangements in the state, and the previous discussion regarding changes to the state-run vaccination hubs would help: \n   \n   I know that the premier is very focused on those key spreader demographics and occupations at the moment and that is the reason for having the change, not the change, but taking advantage of the three to six week rule on the second dose and bring forward more of the first doses that would make that more plausible to achieve. \n   That is for a matter for the premier and how she is putting in place, she has asked us to help her in that program and we are doing everything we can, consistent with a national program, to support her in that effort. I do stress again, if you are in the particularly vulnerable group, I\u2019d urge you to go and get your second dose of that vaccine, or your first. That is for older age groups. \n   If you are in the younger age groups, go and see your doctor. Go and chat to them. Have a chat about the AstraZeneca vaccine in particular and make an informed choice that enables you to take a decision that can see you more protected, see your family more protected and community more protected. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.09am BST \n \n \n  7.59am BST  \n  \n  Morrison also appears to disagree with the characterisation of premier Andrews that Covid-19 is out of control in NSW: \n   \n   What I would note, for the data we see coming out in New South Wales, is they have prevented the exponential growth we have seen in other countries, which has taken hold with Delta. So they have been able to suppress that exponential rate of growth, which is very important. So when you have exponential growth in cases that\u2019s what you would call out of control. And that\u2019s not occurring in New South Wales. And I would reassure people, in particular, that what you are doing now is saving lives, it is working to bring this under control. In Victoria, when they went through the lockdown, they saw cases rise and rise and rise for many, many weeks while they were in lockdown. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.02am BST \n \n \n  7.57am BST  \n  \n  Morrison is asked about comments from earlier today by Victorian premier Daniel Andrews for the NSW government to surround greater Sydney with a ring of steel. He makes clear he believes Sydney is under significant restrictions: \n   \n   The only view that matters on this is the view of the New South Wales premier, because they are responsible for how they manage the lockdown in New South Wales. Of course the premier discussed these issues with her colleagues today and myself and there was, I think, good and positive discussion around that. It was a good opportunity, I think, for the New South Wales premier to spell out in very specific detail the extensive lockdown that is in place in NSW. There is nothing light about the lockdown in Sydney, I can assure you. My family are in it. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.00am BST \n \n \n  7.54am BST  \n  \n  Paul Karp, my fine colleague, is asking Morrison about the NSW request today to be given a greater allocation of Pfizer doses. Morrison: \n   \n   We have already given New South Wales an additional 150,000 doses. That was in immediate response to a request the premier made on 7 July. They have been provided with an additional hundred and 60,000 AstraZeneca doses. More doses will be provided New South Wales as they are available. We will work with them on that. So your assumption would be incorrect. \n   \n  Karp asks Morrison to clarify whether there were extra doses allocated today or not. Morrison: \n   \n   I don\u2019t discuss what happens in National Cabinet. The federal government will be working to support New South Wales and [where there are] extra doses that can be provided to support the plan in place that is what we will do. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.56am BST \n \n \n  7.52am BST  \n  \n  Morrison then proudly quotes Kyle Sandilands: \u201cget vaxxed baby!\u201d \n  \n \n \n  7.51am BST  \n NSW to allow longer gap between Pfizer jabs and shorter gap for AZ \n  \n  Morrison gets into a little more nitty gritty now. He says that in NSW they will slightly tinker with the state-run vaccination centres to allow for a delay on second doses of Pfizer and a shorter gap between second doses of AstraZeneca. These measures are already backed by the Atagi advice, he says, but will allow more flexibility in dose allocation. \n  Morrison: \n   \n   To that end, we discussed and will be confirming over the next 24 hours the ability for, in New South Wales, in their state vaccine centres, for them to do greater amounts of first doses by staying within the medical advice, the target advice, which says that second doses of Pfizer can be extended out to six weeks. So that is an existing regulation. It is an existing approval, it is an existing medical advice. To increase the dose of first doses that can be delivered, maximising greater supply we have available, then we are working to put that in place in New South Wales because of the situation that exists there. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.54am BST \n \n \n  7.49am BST  \n  \n  A little more detail about something I\u2019m not sure many people are interested in. Morrison: \n   \n   A couple of quick points. The freight code, which was important to keep trucks moving across state and territory boundaries, we have tasked the transport ministers to go back to that code and the AHPPC, the medical expert panel, to make sure we have greater consistency in the testing regimes that are being used by those trucking companies and the drivers. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.51am BST \n \n \n  7.45am BST  \n Australia administers 200,000 vaccines in record day \n  \n  It is another record day for vaccinations, Morrison says, with almost 200,000 doses delivered.  \n  \u201cWe have turned that corner,\u201d he says. \n  \n Updated at 8.40am BST \n \n \n  7.44am BST  \n  \n  Not much detail here, but Morrison is saying there were discussions about \u201cfurther support\u201d and about developing the \u201cfour step plan\u201d for the country to come out of the pandemic. \n  \n Updated at 7.44am BST \n \n \n  7.42am BST  \n  \n  Morrison is again imploring those in greater Sydney to go the distance against the Delta variant. \n   \n   This thing only gets beaten by suppressing it. Of course, vaccines can be at the back of those trying to achieve that outcome. That is what we had to do. Today at National Cabinet we had a rather lengthy and extensive discussion about the situation in New South Wales. I would thank New South Wales\u2019s premier for her candour and sharing her plans and arrangements with her colleagues. It was a very good opportunity for people to provide the insights, support and feedback in particular what has happened in Sydney. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.46am BST \n \n \n  7.40am BST  \n Morrison is speaking in Canberra \n  \n  Here is the prime minister, Scott Morrison, speaking from the Lodge. \n  \n \n \n  7.39am BST  \n  \n  Reynolds says there has been about 600,000 claims from NSW for emergency support payments. Victorians were able to apply from today and she expected about 50,000 claims would be lodged, she said. \n  \n \n \n  7.37am BST  \n  \n  Reynolds is asked about the low rates of full vaccination amongst the residents of disability facilities (34%) and workers (27%). \n   \n   When I became minister I was concerned with the low levels of those NDIS participants, particularly those who are most vulnerable in residential disability care.  \n   It was misunderstood about the complexities of vaccinating people with disability who have got very high care needs. So what we\u2019ve done is at the end of May we implemented a new strategy and I\u2019m pleased to say that strategy is working. So today we\u2019ve now got over 50% of registered disability workers who have voluntarily received at least their first vaccination. We now have 75% of people with disability in residential aged care who have received at least their first vaccination. And we\u2019re now nearing 60% of all of that in residential disability care ... So the numbers are increasing rapidly. \n   I can\u2019t change the past but what I have been able to do is implement a new procedure which is clearly working. I would remind you that it is voluntary. There are thousands of ways people across the country with disability can get vaccinated.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.41am BST \n \n \n  7.33am BST  \n  \n  Linda Reynolds, the minister for the NDIS and government services, is speaking to the ABC. She says she supports the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in calling for Atagi to change its AstraZeneca advice: \n   \n   Well, I agree with the call for it to be revised. Absolutely. And we had, we were expecting initially for 20 million doses [for people] to be vaccinated with the AZ. It\u2019s now down to five, which has had a significant impact on our vaccination schedule. Which pleasingly is now up to what we had initially planned, a million doses a week plus. But to speed it up, AZ is an important part of that process. Even with additional vaccines coming online, so additional Pfizer and Moderna. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.38am BST \n \n \n  7.28am BST  \n  \n  Sydney University confirms a case at its dental school in Westmead.

Over the past two weeks he has also visited Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea in a bid to build stronger trade links amid ongoing tensions with China. His office said his two weeks of travel would be followed by two weeks of quarantine. \n  \n Updated at 7.30am BST \n \n \n  7.19am BST  \n Morrison to speak following national cabinet meeting \n  \n  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is due to address reporters in Canberra at 4.30pm. \n  \n \n \n  7.18am BST  \n  \n  Dr Nick Coatsworth, the former deputy chief medical officer, has written a seething opinion piece for the Nine newspapers in which he completely rounds on \u201crisk-adverse academics and medical commentators\u201d who he says made comments that will cost lives: \n   \n   The most egregious example of the influence of risk-averse academics and medical commentators on policy has been anti-AstraZenecism, which has afflicted our rollout. Anti-AstraZenecism was not academic freedom. It was academic dishonesty.Those who denigrated the phase-three studies by the scientifically fallacious comparison of efficacy between Pfizer and AZ have been proven wrong by the excellent performance of the AZ vaccine in real life. Forget the changing advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the real culprits were the \u201cexperts\u201d who had no expertise at all in haematology and thrombosis overstating the blood-clotting risk in traditional and social media, and delivering messages that pushed AZ-eligible Australians to wait for Pfizer. This is a wait that will now cost lives in our community. \n   \n  Coatsworth also wrote that: \n   \n   The philosophy of the risk-averse experts is self-fulfilling. Complain long enough that a government hasn\u2019t gone hard and fast enough, and eventually you will get it right, no matter how wrong you have been in the past. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.21am BST \n \n \n  7.01am BST  \n  \n  The Queensland deputy premier, Steven Miles, has rebuffed the New South Wales government\u2019s suggestion to redirect some of its Pfizer doses to deal with the greater Sydney outbreak. \n  On ABC TV, Miles shared the dire assessment of the situation in Sydney: \n   \n   I understand that\u2019s why national cabinet is going so long - there\u2019s a real focus on what\u2019s happening in Sydney. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that it is a national emergency. This is effectively Australia\u2019s third wave. We had that first wave nationally, the second one in Melbourne, and now a third wave in Sydney. And so I think it\u2019s in all of our interests to help New South Wales get on top of this outbreak and make sure that it doesn\u2019t keep spreading into other states. \n   \n  But Miles rejected calls to redirect Pfizer vaccines: \n   \n   Look, the number of Pfizer vaccines that we have in Queensland is so meagre, I don\u2019t think we could redirect those. The fact is we really only have enough vaccines to give people their second doses who have already had their first. And if we were to redirect those doses, well, they wouldn\u2019t be available for people to get their second. And so I don\u2019t think we would consider putting Queenslanders in that kind of situation, where the benefit of their vaccine is compromised by a delay in the second dose. \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.54am BST  \n  \n  Miles doesn\u2019t take up an invitation to directly comment on whether NSW should have locked down more quickly. But he says that\u2019s what Queensland does: \n   \n   Oh look, plenty of people have judged the decisions we\u2019ve made here. And so I know what that feels like, and I\u2019m going to avoid doing that. We don\u2019t have the intelligence and the knowledge of what\u2019s going on, on the ground, like that state does. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that each state makes those decisions. \n   But what you\u2019ve seen from our government is an approach to move faster with shorter lockdowns, and I think that\u2019s proven particularly effective with these faster-moving strains. Because with a short lockdown, you can have some confidence that you\u2019ve found all your cases and put them into quarantine as well as all of their contacts. That\u2019s the approach that we\u2019ve taken. And look, I don\u2019t want to throw any rocks at New South Wales, for the benefit of the whole country we need them to get on top of this outbreak. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.58am BST \n \n \n  6.51am BST  \n  \n  Queensland\u2019s acting premier Steven Miles is speaking to the ABC from Brisbane.

Prof Peter Shergold from NESA said that students would still receive their marks and university offers this year.  \n  \u201cWe know students want certainty about their exams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognise that students and schools across the state are operating under a variety of different circumstances. We will outline a special illness and misadventure process and any other contingency arrangements needed to ensure equity and fairness for all students.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 6.49am BST \n \n \n  6.35am BST  \n  \n  Following on from his earlier comments, Khorshid also said just now at his media conference in Perth that: \n   \n   The AMA has heard with alarm the new figures from New South Wales today, showing that instead of the current lockdown settings causing Covid numbers to decrease towards zero, we\u2019re in fact seeing them increase, meaning that six days in we are really worried that this lockdown is not going to work. I think we\u2019ve seen that acknowledged today by the premier and the chief health officer of New South Wales, who have now started talking about a new strategy for managing this Delta outbreak in Sydney. And it\u2019s quite possible that Australia\u2019s lockdown strategy - that\u2019s worked so well with all the previous outbreaks we\u2019ve had - is simply not strong enough, not fast enough, to deal with Delta. And it\u2019s possible a new approach, in particular for Sydney but possibly for the rest of the country, will be required. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.38am BST \n \n \n  6.18am BST  \n AMA says Atagi should change AstraZeneca advice \n  \n  The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, says it is unlikely lockdown measures can contain the Delta outbreak in New South Wales and has urged the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) to recommend the AstraZeneca vaccine for more age groups.Currently, the Atagi advice recommends the Pfizer vaccine, which is in short supply and high demand in Australia, \u201cas the preferred vaccine for those aged 16 to under 60 years\u201d due to the risk of rare but severe clotting known as TTS linked to AstraZeneca and more frequent in the under-60 age group.Khorshid said that advice must be changed given the growing number of infections in NSW, with a concerning number of people still in the community, including in workplaces and supermarkets, while infectious. During her daily update on Friday, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said vaccination would now be key to containing the outbreak and getting out of lockdown.\u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have supply,\u201d Khorshid said. \u201cIn my view we need to revisit the recommendation for AstraZeneca around young Australians because, at the moment, that is the vaccine that is most available. But we can\u2019t get that into arms more quickly if people are not willing to have it.\u201cAnd the problem has been they will not have it. So I think we need a revision of that Atagi advice and later today I will be calling on Atagi to change its advice, which at the moment asks individuals under 60 to make their own risk assessment about whether or not to have it, which really isn\u2019t suitable for the NSW crisis in the middle of a pandemic.\u201cIf Atagi agree with the AMA \u2013 and they are the experts \u2013 that the situation in NSW is not getting better but worse, and given vaccination is now the strategy to get NSW out of this lockdown, then we need more to access the AstraZeneca vaccine, given we do not have enough Pfizer.\u201dIn July, Atagi issued advice on the use of Covid-19 vaccines in an outbreak setting in light of the Sydney outbreak. The advice states when there is an outbreak and the supply of Pfizer is limited, people under 60 without immediate access to Pfizer should \u201creassess the benefits to them and their contacts from being vaccinated with Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca, versus the rare risk of a serious side-effect\u201d.But Khorshid said the advice was not adequate because it still put too much onus on individuals to make their own risk assessment. He said people wanted clearer recommendations from the experts during a crisis, and given the negative publicity around AstraZeneca and rare clotting.Read the full story here: \n   \n    Related: Australian Medical Association says NSW Covid lockdown failing and urges change to AstraZeneca advice  \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.37am BST \n \n \n  6.14am BST  \n  \n  Uber breached the Privacy Act in failing to protect the privacy data of an estimated 1.2m Australians following a hack of the company in late 2016. \n  In 2017 it was reported hackers had stolen 57m driver and rider accounts and held the data for $100,000 in ransom money, which Uber paid on the condition the data was destroyed.  \n  The Australian information and privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, found Uber breached the Privacy Act by not taking reasonable steps to protect Australians\u2019 personal information from unauthorised access and to destroy or de-identify data as required. \n  The OAIC found Uber did not conduct a full assessment of the personal information that may have been accessed until almost a year after the breach, and did not disclose the breach until November 2017.  \n  The commissioner said it was important to make a ruling to show that, while the data was held in the United States, the Privacy Act still applies to Australians\u2019 personal information: \n   \n   This determination makes my view of global corporations\u2019 responsibilities under Australian privacy law clear. \n   Australians need assurance that they are protected by the Privacy Act when they provide personal information to a company, even if it is transferred overseas within the corporate group. \n   \n  Uber has been ordered to develop privacy policies in compliance Australian privacy principles. \n  An Uber spokesperson said they welcomed the resolution of the incident and the company learns from its mistakes: \n   \n   We have made a number of technical improvements to the security of our systems, including obtaining ISO 27001 certification of our core rides business information systems and updating internal security policies, as well as making significant changes in leadership, since this incident in 2016. \n   We are confident that these changes in security and governance will address the determination made by the OAIC, and will work with a third-party assessor to implement any further changes required. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.17am BST \n \n \n  6.06am BST  \n  \n  We have referenced it a few times in the coverage today, but here is a full story on the New Zealand government\u2019s decision to shut the trans-Tasman travel bubble for eight weeks: \n   \n    Related: New Zealand shuts Australia travel bubble as Sydney\u2019s Covid outbreak worsens   \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.03am BST  \n  \n  Excellent news for those who are within five kilometres of this particular section of the Yarra River in locked down Melbourne: according to this post on a Richmond residents Facebook group, Salvatore the Seal is back! \n  \n \n \n  5.56am BST  \n  \n  The closure of the trans-Tasman travel bubble for the next eight weeks has thrown doubts over the Wallabies\u2019 upcoming Bledisloe Cup series with the All Blacks. \n  Rugby Australia said on Friday afternoon it had been forced to \u201cevaluate its options\u201d after quarantine-free travel between Australia and New Zealand was suspended due to the current Covid outbreak. \n  The first Bledisloe Test was due to be played at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park on 7 August, the second in Perth on 21 August and the third in Wellington a week later.

Services will not be able to continue to meet this demand unless we see action from the federal government which lifts pressure off families who cannot put food on the table. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.39am BST \n \n \n  5.11am BST  \n  \n  The New South Wales Labor opposition is calling on the Berejiklian government to link greater financial support to the roadmap out of the current lockdown it has foreshadowed. \n  While the Labor opposition has pledged to support the tightened public health orders for parts of south-west Sydney, opposition leader Chris Minns, together with deputy opposition leader Prue Carr and opposition health spokesman Ryan Park, are also calling for greater financial support to match. \n  Specifically they want to see jobkeeper reinstated for NSW, following eligibility issues with the commonwealth\u2019s disaster payments that have left hundreds of thousands in Sydney unable to access the payments. \n  In a statement, NSW Labor says: \n   \n   Harder lockdowns must equal greater financial support. You simply cannot demand one, without delivering the other ... when the premier outlines the roadmap, we need to see the federal-state government economic support package that allows us to stay at home and maintains businesses and livelihoods. \n   We know that western and south-western Sydney aren\u2019t \u2018work from home\u2019 communities. They\u2019re abiding by the health regulations but they also need to leave home to put bread on the table as frontline workers, or in retail or other vital logistics and supply chains. \n   We simply can\u2019t have businesses and workers hit the wall because they are doing the right thing and abiding by the NSW health advice. \n   That is why NSW needs jobkeeper. It saw us through tough lockdowns last time and it\u2019ll see us through this one again. \n   Now is a time for political leaders to be positive, to support their communities, to clearly communicate the health orders, and to ensure the right health and economic support is in place.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.19am BST \n \n \n  5.01am BST  \n  \n  And with that, I return the blog to my esteemed colleague Elias Visontay.

We don\u2019t want to see any pregnant woman severely ill, or in the ICU, as a result of this disease.  \n   While vaccination doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk, it reduces it considerably and we are confident in our advice that the Pfizer vaccination is safe for pregnant women and their babies. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.37am BST \n \n \n  4.21am BST  \n  \n  And here is the video of Victorian premier Daniel Andrews calling for a \u201cring of steel\u201d around Sydney:  \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.12am BST  \n  \n  The federal health department has released a highly redacted report on the operational effectiveness of the Covidsafe contact tracing app, censoring all information about how effective the app has actually been. \n  Using freedom of information law, the Canberra Times was able to get a copy of an independent report the government has been sitting on since the end of March about how well the federal government\u2019s $7m app had worked. \n  The report prepared by Abt Associates and delivered to the government on 31 March details the establishment of the app, and the justifications as to why the app was decided to be the best way to contact trace: \n   \n   Based on the parameters of knowledge and capabilities at the time of app launch, it is believed that the Covidsafe app was the correct tool to employ. \n   \n  But the health department has largely redacted almost all of the discussion about how effective it has been in practice. \n   \n   \n    The heavily redacted report I received this week (after months of being pushed back by the FOI team, I might add) provides none of its findings on the effectiveness. pic.twitter.com/IioaH4lQAq\u2014 sarah basford canales (@sbasfordcanales) July 21, 2021\n    \n   \n  So far the app has only identified 17 close contacts not found through manual contact tracing, and over 500 more found due to an additional date at a NSW exposure site being identified. \n  The report repeats the government\u2019s justifications for why the app was less useful during Victoria\u2019s second lockdown \u2013 that people were not interacting with strangers during lockdown, so it was less useful. \n  The report was supposed to be tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days of it being handed to government under the legislation for the Covidsafe app. The government has breached this requirement.  \n  Taxpayers paid over $200,000 for the report to be prepared. \n  Guardian Australia filed a similar FOI request in May, but it was refused by the health department, and is now being reviewed. \n  \n Updated at 4.19am BST \n \n \n  3.59am BST  \n Frewen says vaccine 'not best way to deal with an immediate outbreak' \n  \n  Lieutenant general John Frewen, who is in charge of the national rollout, has poured cold water on the New South Wales government\u2019s push for extra Pfizer vaccine doses for south-west Sydney. \n  Frewen told the Covid committee that vaccination is just \u201cone part\u201d of the Covid outbreak response, along with lockdown, testing, tracing, social distancing and masking. \n   \n   Vaccination underpins national resilience to Covid, but it is not the best way to deal with an immediate outbreak like this. Our response is to go to the most vulnerable communities \u2013 we\u2019ve done that, with roving clinics to the aged care sector. We are working on encouraging all those over 70 to get dosages done with AstraZeneca. We\u2019ve spoken to some other high priority cohorts, but throwing vaccine at one geographic area does not give an immediate solution. \n   \n  Frewen reiterated that vaccines are given to states and territories on a \u201cper capita basis\u201d \u2013 and any reallocation of Pfizer \u201cwill require the concurrence of other jurisdictions\u201d.  \n   \n   I am not aware of NSW making a case as to why other jurisdictions should prioritise their Pfizer to NSW. \n   \n  Only South Australia has made a formal request for more Pfizer. Asked about Berejiklian\u2019s public appeal at her press conference, Frewen replied that he doesn\u2019t take requests made through the media. \n  There is no reserve of Pfizer to give New South Wales without taking it from other states\u2019 allocation \u2013 but they can have more AstraZeneca, he said. \n  \n Updated at 5.24am BST \n \n \n  3.56am BST  \n Key events from the Victorian Covid update \n  \n  The hour-long Victorian Covid-19 update attended by premier Dan Andrews, chief health officer Brett Sutton and Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar has finished.  \n  Here\u2019s some final key points: \n   \n   Andrews on his call for Sydney to be surrounded by a ring of steel if its outbreak is declared a national emergency: \u201cSydney is on fire with this virus, and we need a ring of steel around Sydney\u201d  \n   Andrews makes an interesting comment relating to schools: he says that even if teachers were prioritised in the vaccine rollout, children would still be unvaccinated, and they have been a key factor in outbreaks of the Delta variant \n   Weimar says he believed that none of the seven people in hospital in Victoria had been vaccinated, but he wants to confirm that \n   Weimar says there were two cases of people packed together at the gates at AAMI Park who contracted Covid-19. He confirms some of the people in the crowd weren\u2019t wearing masks while entering the venue: \u201cThere was a range of behaviours.\u201d \n   There are now 958 people listed as visiting Prahran Market at the same time as a positive case.

We would use police, authorised officers, and if you could get support from the ADF, whether that was for logistics or things of that nature, or whether it was boots on the ground, you know, all of those conversations need to be had.  \n   If Sydney has been declared a national emergency, then my message is very clear, on behalf of all Victorians I am saying, there is a national responsibility to put a ring of steel around Sydney just as we did last year, because that will help stop the spread of the virus across the whole nation. \n   I want to be able to deal with our outbreak, have it settled, and then have thousands of contact tracers on the phone helping out Sydney. I can\u2019t do that when we have cases to chase ... We need to be on hyper alert because even with the strictest border closure ever put in place, we still have people moving around New South Wales and potentially spreading the virus. \n   We need to contain this so we don\u2019t have a national emergency in every part of our nation. \n   \n  Andrews adds that he is not opposed to NSW receiving a greater allocation of vaccine doses. \n  \n Updated at 3.44am BST \n \n \n  3.11am BST  \n  \n  Victoria Covid update \n  Victoria\u2019s Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar is running through details of the 14 cases recorded in the state on Friday: \n   \n   Four are associated with the AAMI Park cluster. \n   Two are associated with Ms Frankies. \n   Two are associated with Trinity Grammar. \n   Single cases from: St Patricks, Bacchus Marsh Grammar, Phillip Island, City of Hume, Westgate tunnel, Young and Jackson\u2019s. \n   \n  Weimar says there are about 3,500 Day 13 tests due over the weekend relating to people who were at a Tier 1 site at the MCG and have been in isolation. People can refuse a Day 1 test in isolation but must have a Day 13 test to be released. \n  \n Updated at 3.50am BST \n \n \n  3.09am BST  \n  \n  Senate Covid committee update \n  Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally is asking federal officials about whether the New South Wales outbreak is a \u201cnational emergency\u201d, as the NSW government is now describing it. \n  Both health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, and chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, described it as a \u201cvery serious situation\u201d \u2013 but neither repeated the language of national emergency.  \n  Kelly said: \n   \n   It is a very serious situation particularly in south-west Sydney but not only south-west Sydney. It is a very diverse community, many are essential workers people who work in construction, aged care. The things we had been doing previously before Delta are proving to be not as effective as has been in the past. We are not alone in this experience. Delta spread to well over 100 countries, and every country that has it is experiencing the same thing. NSW Health is working extremely hard, but it is an enormous challenge. Even with lockdowns \u2013 and they are very strict \u2013 it is proving difficult to bring under control. \n   \n  Kelly confirms the NSW government has asked the federal government for extra vaccines for essential workers, and this has been conveyed to John Frewen, who is in charge of the vaccination rollout. \n  Frewen said the federal government is \u201clooking at how we can support them\u201d and is working on \u201ca number of priority areas\u201d including aged care and over 70s. \n  Frewen said although there is a particular problem in south-west Sydney, the virus can spill out from there to other places \u2013 so he wants to \u201ccontinue at speed across the nation\u201d and must \u201cmanage the national vaccination rollout\u201d.  \n  It sounds like some extra help for south west Sydney is possible \u2013 but not a wholesale re-diversion of vaccines pledged to other states. \n  Kelly notes there are lockdowns in Victoria and South Australia that have been \u201cseeded from this outbreak\u201d and delivering extra vaccines to New South Wales has an \u201copportunity cost\u201d in other places. \n  \n Updated at 3.47am BST \n \n \n  3.07am BST  \n  \n  Senate Covid committee update \n  Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher has been grilling John Frewen and Brendan Murphy about why Australia didn\u2019t have more Pfizer when the blood clot warning was applied to AstraZeneca. \n  Murphy said Australia had \u201cplenty of AstraZeneca\u201d for full population coverage before the program was hit by the \u201cunfortunate thrombotic syndrome\u201d and Atagi advice that limited availability to over 60s \u2013 an oversimplification of the advice, as I wrote about earlier. \n  Asked if there was insufficient redundancy, Murphy said Novavax had been ordered and was meant to come in the second quarter but is now coming in the third due to production delays; and Moderna is coming in the third quarter. \n  He said: \n   \n   We had a diverse supply with a strong focus on domestically produced AstraZeneca. We have full population coverage of Pfizer, we increased Pfizer orders when those events occurred. \n   \n  Murphy explained that Australia ordered 10m Pfizer to begin with because \u201cwe had double population coverage\u201d for both the University of Queensland and AstraZeneca vaccine \u2013 before UQ was discontinued because of false HIV positives and the AstraZeneca clotting issue. Since those occurred \u201cwe increased our Pfizer order\u201d, he said. \n  So were the decisions correct? Murphy said: \n   \n   At the time, the decisions were made by expert panel \u2013 and were appropriate for the circumstances at the time. When we made a strategic investment in Pfizer, none of the vaccines had done phase three clinical trials; and no mRNA had been approved in humans. \n   \n  The Australian government preferred protein based UQ and adenovirus based AstraZeneca, but made a \u201cstrategic investment\u201d in Pfizer. \n  \n Updated at 3.51am BST \n \n \n  3.02am BST  \n  \n  Victoria Covid update \n  Andrews says he agrees with his NSW counterpart Gladys Berejiklian that the Sydney outbreak is a national emergency. But he says that means there should be a ring of steel surrounding Sydney so that cases don\u2019t spread around Australia: \n   \n   The premier of New South Wales has used the term that there is a national emergency going on up in Sydney at the moment. I don\u2019t disagree with that. \n   They have a very significant challenge. Many, many cases and many of those cases out and about for the entirety of their infectious period. Then another number of people who are out and about for at least some of their infectious period. That trend is not what you want to see. Any help we can provide of course we stand ready to do that. \n   That can be practical support or it can be some of the learnings, some of the practical experience that we tragically have as Victorians given what we went through last year. I want to just make this point: if there is a national emergency \u2013 and I\u2019m not doubting that for a moment in Sydney \u2013 then it is a national responsibility that Sydneysiders are locked into Sydney. We need a ring of steel around Sydney so that this virus is not spreading into other parts of our nation. \n   \n  Andrews said he would call for the ring of steel at the national cabinet meeting later today. \n  \n Updated at 3.26am BST \n \n \n  3.00am BST  \n South Australia update \n  \n  SA premier Steven Marshall is also giving a press conference. \n  The state reported one new case earlier this morning.  \n  Asked whether the state would come out of lockdown as planned after seven days, Marshall said \u201call the early signs were good\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.01am BST \n \n \n  2.59am BST  \n Victorian Covid update \n  \n  The Victorian premier Dan Andrews is giving a Covid-19 update in Melbourne. \n  He says at least 10 of the 14 new cases recorded in Victoria were in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period. It is believed those who weren\u2019t in isolation were only in the community for about 24 hours. It is possible one of these people was also in isolation (so it could be 11/14). \n  \n Updated at 3.03am BST \n \n \n  2.58am BST  \n  \n  NSW Brad Hazzard is asked about people over 60 who are not yet booking their vaccines because they are waiting for Pfizer to be available for their age group. \n  He pleads with them to go and get the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it is about \u201csurvival\u201d. \n  He said: \n   \n   There is oceans of AstraZeneca in New South Wales. There is also vast amounts of virus in south-west and western Sydney. All we\u2019re saying here at the moment is your obligation to yourself, to the community, to New South Wales and to Australia, because this could leak further into other states, is to go and get the jabs of AstraZeneca. \n   \n  The NSW Covid press conference has now ended. \n  \n Updated at 3.00am BST \n \n \n  2.53am BST  \n  \n  Back to the NSW Covid press conference. \n  Chief health officer Kerry Chant says the state may push out the interval between doses of Pfizer to six weeks, as the state moves to a strategy of maximising first doses of the vaccine available for south western Sydney. She says this could include cancelling Pfizer bookings for second doses in coming weeks. \n  Chant said: \n   \n   It may be that we have to make hard choices, I mean this is a very hard situation. And we may have to make decisions to delay the the Pfizer interval to six weeks, you can have it out to six weeks to actually bring forward doses [for others]. \n   We might have to accept that any vaccines that I held off for a second dose administration that you might have kept because you know you\u2019ve delivered the first, that we actually trust the supply chains because we\u2019ve got that magnitude of a couple of weeks to bring them forward. So at this point, there is an urgency to get as many jabs as possible. \n   Can I just express the fact that some of those changes will impact on individuals, it may be that we need to cancel your bookings, but we have to make these hard choices. If we are going to see these numbers stabilise first and then decline. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.08am BST \n \n \n  2.46am BST  \n New Zealand shuts travel bubble with Australia \n  \n  New Zealand is shutting down the quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia for two months, as the country grapples with a number of serious outbreaks of Covid-19. \n  New Zealand had already paused travel with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The new pause applies to all of Australia for the next 8 weeks. \n  At a press briefing on Friday, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said because of the Delta variant there was \u201cgreater risk now \u2026 than when we opened the travel bubble\u201d.  \n   \n   Covid has changed and so must we. \n   \n  Ardern said that she \u201cwant[s] to acknowledge the impact it is having very directly on people\u2019s lives. Covid-19 is devastating\u201d. \n  Ardern said the government \u201cremains committed\u201d to the travel bubble and hoped it would reopen at some stage. \n  The New Zealand government held an urgent cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss the decision. On Friday, New South Wales had reported a record-breaking 136 new infections and on Thursday premier Gladys Berejikilian warned that Covid case numbers will continue to rise in Sydney.  \n  A release from the PM\u2019s office said: \n   \n   For the next seven days there will be managed return flights for New Zealanders from all states and territories that will require proof of a negative pre-departure test. Additionally, those who have been in NSW will still have to go into MIQ for 14 days. And those who have been in Victoria must self-isolate upon return and have a negative Day 3 test. \n   \n  New Zealand has not had a community acquired case of Covid-19 since February. As of this week, 15% of New Zealand\u2019s 16+ population was fully vaccinated, and 22% had had a first dose.  \n  \n Updated at 2.53am BST \n \n \n  2.45am BST  \n  \n  Guardian Australia\u2019s Anne Davies asked Gladys Berejiklian if NSW\u2019s plea for more Pfizer doses will be a direct request to other states to give up their allocations of Pfizer for south-west Sydney. \n  Berejiklian: \n   \n   I think those conversations we need to have a national cabinet, we need to list have a strategy national cabinet that does think about the options for getting more jabs in arms in Sydney, especially those five local government areas, and that is why we are raising the issue. \n   \n  Berejiklian notes NSW has done the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d over the 18 months \u2013 presumably in hotel quarantine intake \u2013 and that NSW\u2019s situation now \u201cis not just a challenge for New South Wales but a challenge for the nation\u201d. \n  She is asked if she warned the prime minister before today\u2019s press conference about her plea. She says: \n   \n   I do not have the capacity to address anything beyond the boundary of New South Wales. It is not my job to comment on anything beyond what is my responsibility as the premier of the largest state of the nation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.49am BST \n \n \n  2.40am BST  \n  \n  Even though people over 40 are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine that Atagi says is the preference for their age group, NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is pleading for anyone over 40 to get the AstraZeneca vaccine as it is more readily available. \n  Berejiklian has said the extra Pfizer doses she is calling for from the federal government will need to be targeted for younger people in south-west Sydney. \n   \n   There\u2019s millions of people who are over 40 in New South Wales, can I make that clear there\u2019s lots of AstraZeneca available if you\u2019re over 40. \n   There is no reason today, why you shouldn\u2019t be getting the AstraZeneca. \n   Whilst we\u2019re focusing on those five local government areas, please be clear, as we\u2019ve said that you should be considering getting the AstraZeneca, anywhere. Anywhere you live in New South Wales. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.43am BST \n \n \n  2.34am BST  \n  \n  Kerry Chant is at pains to encourage people in her state to take AstraZeneca vaccines.  \n  She says at the NSW state hubs \u201cmany bookings for AstraZeneca go wanting\u201d, and encourages people to book.  \n  This follows comments from health minister Brad Hazzard yesterday that at the Sydney Olympic Park vaccination hub on Wednesday, 9,000 Pfizer doses were administered compared with just 50 AstraZeneca doses. \n  \n \n \n  2.29am BST  \n  \n  Chief health officer Kerry Chant is asked when she wants to see extra Pfizer doses for the state.  \n  She says \u201cI want to see them today\u201d. \n   \n   My sense of urgency is absolute urgency so I think we need to be seeing vaccines in arms on Saturday, Sunday, Monday. \n   \n  Regarding AstraZeneca, Chant says \u201cwe need to correct the mythology about AstraZeneca\u201d.  \n   \n   In the context of the Delta threat, I just cannot understand why people would not be taking the opportunity to go out and get AstraZeneca in droves. \n   \n  Chant notes she has taken AstraZeneca, and has recommended it to her husband and her mother-in-law.  \n   \n   I just want to say that the chief health officer would not recommend AstraZeneca to someone that they care about if they had concerns that the risks of AstraZeneca are infinitesimally small compared to the benefits. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.33am BST \n \n \n  2.26am BST  \n  \n  While the state wants Pfizer doses directed specifically to south-west Sydney, Kerry Chant pleads with anyone across New South Wales, regardless of where they live, to make a booking for AstraZeneca.  \n  Chant said there are two reasons for the state\u2019s new vaccine plea \u2013 to prevent against illness, but also because a first dose will help reduce transmission to some degree. \n  Health minister Brad Hazzard reiterates what Chant said earlier, that the state\u2019s Covid outbreak is a \u201cnational emergency\u201d. \n  He said \u201cin a national emergency every citizen has a duty to do what they can to defeat, whatever is happening to us in this case, it is a Delta variant of the virus\u201d. \n  Premier Gladys Berejiklian follows this up, noting the large number of younger people in south-west Sydney: \n   \n   What is the bottom line, we need a refocus of additional doses to make sure as many people in the community with at least the first dose as possible because even with the first dose, it reduces your chances of spreading it to as many people as we are seeing it occur now. That is our priority \u2013 first jabs. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.29am BST \n \n \n  2.16am BST  \n NSW CHO wants Pfizer for essential workers under 40 in south-west Sydney \n  \n  NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant is back after a few days, and she is speaking to the tighter restrictions she has recommended. \n  Chant said: \n   \n   I have advised the government today that this is a national emergency and requires additional measures to reduce the case numbers. What we are seeing is that the actions we have taken to date have averted many cases.  \n   But what we are not seeing is the turnaround that we would have liked to see at this stage. And I\u2019m concerned that we need to put in place urgent additional measures, what I\u2019m recommending strongly is that our vaccination efforts are refocused on those affected LGAs. Every day, people from those LGAs have to go out to work to keep our city going.  \n   \n  About essential workers in these areas, Chant said: \n   \n   We also know that, as I indicated that the group of workers that keep the society going is this group of workers in the 20 to 49 year old age group in south-western Sydney. Under 40s would not have been routinely eligible for vaccination, in terms of Pfizer. And what I\u2019ve recommended to government is we urgently do mass vaccination of those workers to stem the transmission risk. We know the vaccines do that because they reduce the risk. If you\u2019re vaccinated, even one dose, it reduces your risk of onward transmission. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.19am BST \n \n \n  2.11am BST  \n NSW Health records new Covid death \n  \n  Gladys Berejiklian has announced a new Covid death in her state, a 89-year-old male. \n  Details of the death are brief as the death is recent (it happened after 8pm last night) and authorities want to make sure family members have been notified. \n  Berejiklian said: \n   \n   I also want to say that tragically, as we see more cases, develop, we will also see more hospitalisations and more people in intensive care and regrettably, we did have an additional death overnight, which I\u2019ve only just learned about. \n   I just want to foreshadow that unfortunately, we\u2019re going to see more of this as the case numbers increase. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.15am BST \n \n \n  2.08am BST  \n NSW to plead with national cabinet for more Pfizer \n  \n  NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has called for a refocus of the national vaccination strategy, specifically for more Pfizer doses for Sydney. \n   \n   What we have done as a government is refocus our efforts in distributing vaccines in south-west Sydney, we have a micro plan for how we will get not only more doses of AstraZeneca in arms, but we also have to acknowledge that that is a very young population in those communities, and we need at least more first doses of Pfizer. \n   We will be taking to national cabinet through the advice of the chief health officer strongly advising a recommendation that consideration be given to at least having more people having at least one dose of the vaccine which reduces transmission. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.12am BST \n \n \n  2.05am BST  \n Restrictions tightened in south-west Sydney \n  \n  Berejiklian said the crisis cabinet met this morning to tighten restrictions in south-western Sydney. \n  She said: \n   \n   Dr Chant and her team advised us that the situation that exists now in New South Wales, namely around south-western and now Western Sydney suburbs, is regarded as a national emergency. For that purpose and for that reason the New South Wales government will be taking action in relation to that. \n   First and foremost, the local government areas of both Cumberland and Blacktown local government areas, will also be subject to workers are not being allowed to leave those communities unless the health and emergency workers were on the authorised list of workers.  \n   The list for what is critical, already exists, so we ask people to look at that list to make sure they do not leave the local government area which is defined by the suburbs in which they live unless they work in health, aged care, or are on that authorised list which already exists. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.07am BST \n \n \n  2.02am BST  \n NSW records 136 new cases \n  \n  There are 136 new locally acquired cases in New South Wales.  \n  Premier Gladys Berejiklian said 53 of those cases were infectious in the community.  \n   \n   There is no doubt that the numbers are not going in the direction we were hoping they would at this stage. It is fairly apparent that we will not be close to zero next Friday. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.04am BST \n \n \n  1.59am BST  \n  \n  NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is about to front a press conference to provide today\u2019s Covid numbers.  \n  She has already warned that cases today are likely to be higher than they were yesterday, when 124 new cases were announced.  \n  \n \n \n  1.51am BST  \n One quarter of aged and disability care workers fully vaccinated \n  \n  Lieutenant General, John Frewen, is appearing before the Covid committee, explaining that since he came on board in week 16 of the vaccine rollout, Australia has gone from 5.2m vaccine doses administered to 10.6m in week 22.Frewen revealed he will release the national vaccination plan after national cabinet today \u2013 including three main themes: \u201ccoordination and efficiency\u201d, \u201cpublic confidence and getting people motivated\u201d, and ensuring the rollout is \u201csafe and efficient\u201d. \n  Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher is querying why it has taken this long to develop a plan. Frewen agreed that these are three areas where we \u201ccan make enhancements\u201d, but stops short of calling the previous plan deficient. \n  Frewen gave an update on vaccination rates in aged and disability care: \n   \n   Aged care residents: 86.3% have received their first dose and 82.3% are fully vaccinated. \n   Aged care workers: 47.2% have had a first dose and 27.8% are fully vaccinated. \n   Disability residents: 57.7% have had a first dose, and 34.7% are fully vaccinated. \n   Disability workers: 50.9% have had a first dose and 27.3% are fully vaccinated. \n   \n  The health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, is explaining that the federal health department (not national cabinet) had decided to jab residents first before staff \u2013 despite both being in category 1A \u2013 because of international experience about staff absences after vaccination. \n  \n Updated at 2.00am BST \n \n \n  1.49am BST  \n  \n  We don\u2019t yet have today\u2019s official numbers for Sydney, but there\u2019s talk of bad numbers today on Twitter.  \n   \n   \n    We are in for a shocker today.\u2014 Chris O'Keefe (@cokeefe9) July 23, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.46am BST  \n Half of people barred from Covid disaster payment at risk of homelessness, says Acoss \n  \n  Nearly half a million workers in NSW have applied for and been granted the Covid-19 disaster payment, however an additional 400,000 unemployed or part-time workers across greater Sydney remain ineligible for the payment because they were already receiving some form of welfare. \n  Almost half of those barred from the disaster payment are now at risk of homelessness, according to the Australian Council of Social Services. Acoss has renewed calls to either expand the eligibility to anyone under lockdown, or at least raise all existing Centrelink payments to $600 so no one who has lost work is worse off. \n  In a report released on Friday, Acoss notes data from its survey of 88 people living in greater Sydney who are unable to access the disaster payments that found every respondent was now struggling with living costs under the lockdown. \n  The lockdown had forced 53% of respondents out of paid work who now had to rely on the base rate of jobseeker $315 with little prospect of gaining further work until the lockdown lifts. Meanwhile, 49% of respondents said they were at risk of homelessness as a result of lost work and inability to access the disaster payments. \n  Jade, a university student who lives in Sydney, worked in hospitality and received youth allowance payments before the lockdown. She now receives $320 dollars per week, $280 of which she spends on rent. \n  \u201cThis barely covers the cost of groceries. On top of that I have medical bills, phone bills, utility bills, car payments and so on\u2026This is simply impossible,\u201d Jade said. \n  Others surveyed who have been barred from the disaster payments reported being unable to afford new glasses. \n  \u201cI can\u2019t afford healthy food. I can\u2019t afford a new winter coat or new warm winter pyjamas. I can\u2019t afford to run my heater every evening. I wear a jumper to bed and I have three extra blankets on my bed so that I\u2019m warm when I sleep,\u201d Aeryn, a Sydney resident, said. \n  Cassandra Goldie, Acoss chief executive, said eligibility for the disaster payments was presenting \u201ca public health issue\u201d because \u201cpeople can\u2019t stay home in lockdown if they lose their home because they cannot afford to keep it\u201d. \n  Goldie also wants to see Commonwealth rent assistance increase, and the reintroduction of targeted jobkeeper-style payments for industries particularly affected by lockdowns. \n  \n Updated at 1.53am BST \n \n \n  1.34am BST  \n  \n  We have a few more details about the purpose-built quarantine facility set for Melbourne.  \n  The federal government has awarded the contract to build the Centre for National Resilience at Mickleham.  \n  Construction will begin from early August and there is a target of having the first 500 beds (of what will ultimately be a 1,000-bed capacity) opening by the end of the year.  \n  Australia\u2019s international arrival caps remain at about 3,000 per week. \n   \n   \n    Contract awarded to deliver Centre for National Resilience at Mickleham @Birmo #auspol pic.twitter.com/SaC7esMLYH\u2014 Political Alert (@political_alert) July 22, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.39am BST \n \n \n  1.31am BST  \n  \n  There are still a few Covid press conferences to get through this morning.  \n  NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian will provide a Covid update at 11am.  \n  We\u2019re also expecting South Australian authorities to provide a Covid update at 11:30am (11am local time in SA). \n  There will also be a Victorian Covid update at some point. \n  Don\u2019t want to miss out on any of this morning\u2019s news?

Qantas says there have been no other reports of positive Covid cases from the flights the crew member was on.  \n  At the Queensland government\u2019s Covid press conference earlier this morning, authorities said the woman\u2019s virus sequence has been linked to the New South Wales outbreak.  \n  In its statement, Qantas also points out that crew members and passengers are required to wear masks on flights.  \n  The statement said: \n   \n   The crew member is currently in self-isolation and we are providing them our full support as they focus on their recovery. Investigations by Queensland Health and Qantas Medical are underway to determine how the crew member contracted the virus. \n   \n  The crew member operated the following flights on a 74-seat Dash 8 Q400 aircraft: \n  Sunday 11 July \n   \n   QF2534 Brisbane to Longreach \n   QF2535 Longreach to Brisbane \n   QF2346 Brisbane to Gladstone \n   \n  Monday 12 July \n   \n   QF2331 Gladstone to Brisbane \n   QF2374 Brisbane to Hervey Bay \n   QF2375 Hervey Bay to Brisbane \n   \n  The cabin crew member did not leave the airport in Longreach or Hervey Bay. \n  Qantas has sent the flight passenger lists to Queensland Health, and is working with it to contact customers. \n  The airline has previously called for domestic flight crew to receive Covid vaccine priority.  \n  \n Updated at 1.24am BST \n \n \n  1.08am BST  \n  \n  Queensland deputy prime minister Steven Miles says he believes premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will attend the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics tonight.  \n  Miles also said the premier told him she was not offended, after Australian Olympic Committee boss John Coates publicly ordered her to attend the ceremony after previously saying she wouldn\u2019t.  \n  Miles said \u201cwe saw how important the IOC considers her attendance\u201d, and that Coates\u2019 comments at a press conference yesterday were only \u201ca snippet\u201d of an ongoing dialogue.  \n  \u201cI think we can all move on,\u201d Miles said.  \n  Queensland\u2019s Covid press conference then ends.  \n  \n Updated at 1.15am BST \n \n \n  12.59am BST  \n  \n  Queensland health minister Yvette D\u2019Ath says Queensland has only vaccinated about one in four of its eligible population.  \n  She said her state ultimately needs to administer 8.5 million doses. \n  She takes a swipe at the federal government over vaccine supply, saying \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how many people we prioritise, we still don\u2019t have the vaccine yet\u201d. \n  In good news though, D\u2019Ath says there has been over 70% vaccine take up among communities in the Torres Strait. \n  \n \n \n  12.53am BST  \n  \n  I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Elias Visontay.

She said the woman does travel to regional parts of NSW.  \n  Young says the state found out about the case yesterday afternoon but has not yet been able to contract trace all of the passengers on those flights. \n  \n Updated at 12.52am BST \n \n \n  12.48am BST  \n  \n  The Queensland deputy premier Steven Miles has addressed that positive result from sewage testing in the Byron Bay area in NSW. The Byron area is part of the border zone with Queensland. Miles said the state was monitoring the situation: \n   \n   This has just recently come to hand. New South Wales is not yet aware of any cases in Byron Bay but clearly, given the fact that Byron is within the border zone that we announced yesterday and implemented overnight, we will be monitoring that closely.  \n   It underlines how critical it is that people in that border zone only travel for those essential reasons that were outlined. What is at stake is the border zone itself. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.49am BST \n \n \n  12.45am BST  \n  \n  Young says Queensland Health is still working with the woman to determine whether there are any venues of concern, but has asked the communities of Gladstone, Longreach, Hervey Bay and obviously Brisbane to be on alert for any symptoms to get tested. \n  \n Updated at 12.47am BST \n \n \n  12.42am BST  \n Queensland flight attendant tests positive to Delta variant linked to NSW outbreak \n  \n  Queensland deputy premier Steven Miles and the chief medical Dr Jeanette Young are giving an update now.  \n  The state has recorded one new community case, a woman in her 30s who works as a flight attendant for regional Qantas routes and lives in Banyo in Brisbane. \n  The woman crewed six flights on the 11th and 12th of July while she is believed to have been infectious.  \n  The flights are: \n  11th July: \n   \n   Brisbane to Longreach flight 2534 \n   Longreach to Brisbane flight 2535 \n   Brisbane to Gladstone flight 2346 \n   \n  She stayed overnight at the Mercure Hotel in Gladstone. Then, on 12 July, worked on these flights: \n   \n   Gladstone to Brisbane flight 2331 \n   Brisbane to Hervey Bay flight 2374 \n   Hervey Bay to Brisbane 2375 \n   \n  Young says the woman\u2019s genome sequence is linked directly backed to \u201cthe NSW cluster\u201d.

On Friday, Justice Robert Bromwich, summarily dismissed the claim. \n  Ashby had sought a total of $4.5m from the commonwealth, $3,667,840 for his own costs and $783,000 to cover legal costs incurred by his solicitor, Michael Harmer.Exactly what the financial impact on Ashby will be is unclear. As recently as June 2020, the commonwealth was still pursuing Ashby for $87,696 in legal costs.

People should not have to jump through hoops to get the assistance they have been promised. \n   \n  The MP made the push with disability spokesman Bill Shorten and emergency management spokesman Murray Watt. \n  The trio demanded the Coalition government give an \u201ciron-clad guarantee\u201d the waiting period would be waived for people moving back onto jobseeker from the disaster payment. \n  The scheme provides up to $600 a week for people in hotspot areas who have lost at least 20 hours of work in a seven-day period, and $375 for those who have lost between eight and 19 hours. \n  Meanwhile, the jobseeker rate is $310.40 a week for single people with no children and $282.70 for someone in a relationship, excluding the rental supplement. \n  The dole rises to $333.75 for single people with children and as well as for those aged 60 or older if they\u2019ve been on the payment for nine months straight. \n  Advocacy groups have repeatedly called on the government to expand disaster payments to people on welfare, so they don\u2019t have to choose. \n  \n Updated at 11.32pm BST \n \n \n  11.14pm BST  \n  \n  Queensland is the first cab off the rank this morning.

My name is Michael McGowan, filling in for Matilda Boseley. I\u2019ll be taking you through this morning\u2019s breaking news. \n  Late last night the New South Wales health department announced it had found fragments of Covid-19 in Byron Bay\u2019s wastewater in the far north.  \n  The sewage treatment plant serves about 19,000 people in Byron Bay, Wategos, Suffolk Park, Sunrise, and Broken Head. There are no known cases in the Byron region, and NSW Health called the finding \u201cof great concern\u201d. \n  NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian yesterday warned cases in the state were expected to rise again today. It comes as my colleague Sarah Martin and I reveal today the state has taken up just 145,000 of the almost 1 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine allocated to it by the Commonwealth, leaving vaccinations to either stockpile or be directed overseas. \n  With three states in lockdown and National Cabinet meeting today there is plenty to get to.  \n  \n", "The race for a Covid vaccine: inside the Australian lab working round the clock to produce 100m doses [2020-10-10T19:00:45Z]": "Some call it the \u201chappy soup\u201d. Take a dash of modified Covid-19 protein DNA, mix it with cells from a Chinese hamster\u2019s ovary, and place the combination in two state-of-the-art 2,000L bioreactors in a sprawling scientific facility on Melbourne\u2019s northern fringes. The result? A broth that, once purified and combined with an immune booster, could help end the Covid-19 crisis as we know it. For months, much hope has rested on the vaccine technology developed by the University of Queensland, which has produced a version of the virus unable to use its crown \u2013 or corona \u2013 of spikes to attach to target cells inside the human body. But if hopes are realised and the UQ vaccine is found to be safe and effective, what next? How will Australia manufacture it at the dizzying scale required to bring the nation out of crisis? How the vaccine works The Guardian has been given a unique insight into the operations of CSL, the company tasked with manufacturing 100m doses of the UQ vaccine and tens of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, one of the world\u2019s other great hopes. Production will take place in CSL\u2019s biotech manufacturing facility in Broadmeadows, a lab directed by a softly spoken, bespectacled scientist named Phil Elliott. Elliott and his team are already manufacturing the UQ vaccine to aid in the clinical trials and to ensure it is available to be distributed across Australia and New Zealand as soon as possible, once deemed safe. \u201cIf the trials continue to prove successful and deliver the outcomes that we are all hoping that they do, we will have manufactured sufficient material to enable the Australian and New Zealand population to have access to the vaccine candidates for administration ,\u201d Elliott says. \u201cThe team are very excited to be able to say they have been involved in what\u2019s a globally significant activity.\u201d   Related: How vaccine hesitancy could undermine Australia\u2019s Covid response    The process of infection relies on the virus using the spike proteins on its outer surface to attach on to human ACE2 receptors \u2013 a protein on the surface of many cells, including in organs and on tongues. Once attached, the spike transforms and unfolds, hooking into the cell and crashing the virus particle and cell together, forming a channel through which a string of viral genetic material can pass into the human cell. When the body\u2019s immune system fires up to combat the virus, much of its effort goes toward that spike protein. UQ has effectively taken the Covid-19 genetic sequence, isolated the section that codes for the spike protein, and changed that sequence to include a clamp that locks three spike proteins together in the form they exist in before they try to bind with human cells. The upshot? The body gets all the immune response with none of the infection and is vaccinated against future Covid-19 infection.    The process for manufacturing the UQ vaccine begins when CSL receives the DNA that codes for the modified spike proteins. The DNA is then introduced into mammalian cells \u2013 most often a cell line originally derived from the ovary of a single Chinese hamster \u2013 and placed into the bioreactors at CSL\u2019s facility. It starts off small. The mammalian cells making the spike protein are grown in small volumes of roughly 50ml. Then 100ml, and 200ml. And on, and on, until you start to get the kinds of quantities you need to produce a vaccine. \u201cUltimately you have to scale up the growth of those [Chinese hamster ovary] cells to a very large volume so you can produce sufficient quantities,\u201d CSL\u2019s chief scientist, Andrew Nash, explains. \u201cSo in our case you end up in a 2,000L bioreactor.\u201d   Related: Will a vaccine or recovery from the virus give us long-term immunity to Covid-19?    The cells grow continuously for about 12 days, all the while producing the spike protein so crucial to the UQ vaccine. Once the 2,000L reactor is full, it is harvested and purified. The goal here is simple: separate out the spike protein from the mammalian cells and any other unwanted byproduct and debris to make the best possible vaccine. \u201cThe more purified you can make the protein antigen you want to use in the vaccine, the best chance that you have of getting an immune response that is directed towards that protein,\u201d Nash says. \u201cAnd the less chance you\u2019ve got of having side-effects being associated with debris from the cells or the unwanted byproducts of that bioreactive process.\u201d The process is completed by combining the purified spike proteins with an adjuvant, an agent that boosts the immune system, known formally as MF59. It\u2019s a critical step for people with weaker immune systems \u2013 the elderly, for example \u2013 to make sure they are protected from the viral infection. The same adjuvant has been used safely for many years in flu vaccines. The challenge is the urgency The process is not unusual for CSL. The manufacturing of the UQ vaccine \u2013 a type of recombinant protein vaccine \u2013 is not anything CSL hasn\u2019t done before. The scale of production needed, while immense, is also well within CSL\u2019s capacity. CSL estimates it can produce 100m doses of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of next year. About 51m will go to Australia and another 51m will go to developing nations in a deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global body seeking to ensure equitable vaccine distribution. The challenge in all of this, though, is the urgency. The vaccine development process has been compressed by taking steps that would usually be linear, and conducting them in parallel. That means, for example, scaling up manufacturing while vaccines are still in trial phase.    \u201cThe main issue for us was the facilities are used for our own R&amp;D processes and we have a very active portfolio and pipeline of projects,\u201d Nash says. \u201cThe challenge is finding a way to integrate the manufacture of vaccines in with what is our business as usual. Given the circumstances with the pandemic, we\u2019ve set aside our business as usual and have found ways to manufacture the vaccine.\u201d Manufacturing a vaccine at trial stage is rare, simply because of the risks of making such a huge investment in an unproven vaccine. Prof Paul Griffin, the director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland, says that vaccine manufacturing typically does not begin until phase-three clinical trials are complete. \u201cThis is a huge investment in that scaling up process that CSL would be involved in, because it does often take a lot of time, and a lot of money in terms of infrastructure and expertise and other things, so normally it\u2019s not contemplated until the phase three,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd of course, not every vaccine that gets to phase three trials will be successful. \u201cSo you\u2019re spending potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to scale up manufacturing for something that you may find doesn\u2019t actually work. \u201cIt is a huge investment but you know one that is certainly worth it at the moment, given how important the vaccine will be.\u201d    Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University, says manufacturing vaccines requires a huge amount of infrastructure and expertise, the kind that only CSL has in Australia. The speed of the vaccine development process has caused some concern among the broader public. Vaccine hesitancy looms as a potentially significant barrier to the uptake of any Covid-19 vaccine, which the prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants distributed to 95% of the population. But both Nash and Griffin say there is no reason for concern about the speed of the process. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of public focus on what\u2019s happening at the moment,\u201d Nash says. \u201cWhile there\u2019s a lot of pressure to come up with something as fast as possible, I think everyone is resisting the temptation to cut any corners when it comes to safety, because ultimately, that\u2019s not where anybody wants to be.\u201d Griffin says many of the steps being accelerated sit between the clinical trials.    \u201cSo what we\u2019ve done to really hasten the process is basically cut out a lot of the steps in between the clinical trials that often take so long, and it is those steps that are often responsible for the very significant time delays that we often have developing these sorts of products,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cBut what is important is that we actually haven\u2019t shortened any of the key steps.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear when, and if, a Covid-19 vaccine might be available. If it does prove safe and effective, and CSL manufactures the millions of doses required, the next step is distribution, a process itself fraught with difficulty. That is a problem for the federal government to consider. In the meantime, Nash and his team are working round the clock to ensure the vaccine is in ready supply. \u201cIf you just take this as an individual episode, the pandemic, people within CSL realise this is really important and all the additional work that is required is very much worthwhile,\u201d he says. \u201cWorking for a company, CSL works a lot in rare disease, and we understand our patients and their issues very well, and I think that is often a very motivating factor for our scientists and product development people. This is just an urgent extension of that.\u201d", "Australia lagging on contributions to global body funding Covid vaccine research [2020-08-13T17:30:45Z]": "Australia\u2019s contribution to a global body funding Covid-19 vaccine research is half that of New Zealand\u2019s and a fraction of the UK\u2019s and Canada\u2019s, data shows. Scott Morrison has been vocal in his assertion that whoever discovers a successful Covid-19 vaccine, if one is discovered, must share it with the rest of the world. \u201cThere are many projects that are under way around the world and we have a process for identifying those that we believe we can take an early position on,\u201d the prime minister said on Sunday. \u201cBut the other thing Australia has been saying, and it\u2019s supported strongly by the premiers, and I made this point earlier in the week, and that is whoever finds this vaccine must share it.\u201d Morrison\u2019s comments echo the World Health Organization\u2019s fears that vaccine nationalism may limit the equitable distribution of a successful vaccine, as it has in previous crises.   Related: Covid vaccine tracker: when will we have a coronavirus vaccine?    Australia has committed a considerable amount overall to vaccine development. It has invested $333m in vaccines, therapeutics and Covid-19 medicines, including $256m in vaccines. But its contributions to one of the main international organisations working to fund vaccine research and development, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), is less generous. Cepi is dedicated to ensuring fears such as those Morrison expressed on inequitable distribution are not realised. Australia has contributed US$4.8m (A$6.7m) to Cepi during the Covid-19 crisis. Cepi has received a total of US$1.4bn from governments, private companies, and philanthropists.   Contributions graph   Australia\u2019s contribution sits well below New Zealand, a nation with a far smaller economy, which has given US$9.2m. Comparable nations such as Canada and the UK have given Cepi US$28.2m and US$278m, respectively. A Cepi spokeswoman said Australia had made separate contributions in 2018 and 2019, of US$1.5m and US$3.2m respectively, though they were not for Covid-19 vaccine development. The organisation is still desperately searching for additional funding. \u201cCepi urgently needs $700m to continue its R&amp;D work to invest in additional Covid-19 vaccine candidates to increase the number of shots on goal at finding a safe and effective vaccine and to advance development of our existing Covid-19 vaccine candidates,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Australia has made other contributions to vaccine development that do not directly involve Cepi, including $5m to fund the University of Queensland\u2019s molecular clamp vaccine development, and an active grant round of $13.6m to support promising Covid-19 development projects. It is also engaged in direct procurement with leading international vaccine candidates, and says this process is \u201chighly advanced with multiple candidates\u201d.   Related: Will a vaccine or recovery from the virus give us long-term immunity to Covid-19?    A spokesman for the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government was also participating in the international Covax facility, an international consortium designed to give participant nations access to vaccine candidates. Australia is also examining onshore manufacturing, including through the pharmaceutical giant CSL. Hunt\u2019s office said the government was assured that CSL had the capacity to produce sufficient vaccine quantities for the entire Australian population, either through licence from abroad or working directly with Australian-based vaccines developers. \u201cWe are confident that these investments and actions will secure early and sufficient access to a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d Hunt\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cThe Australian government is deeply committed to ensuring all Australians have access to a world class health system, now and beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe government is assured that CSL has the capacity to produce sufficient vaccine for the entire Australian population, either for Australian-based vaccines or under licence for leading international vaccines.\u201d The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said Australia must do more to fund vaccine development, including by contributing a greater amount to Cepi. \u201cThe Morrison government needs to increase Australia\u2019s investment in a vaccine, including in our contribution to Cepi,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe Morrison government has unfortunately been very tardy on almost every aspect of Covid vaccine development, from local research to supply agreements to support for global efforts.\u201d Hunt\u2019s spokesman said Australia was \u201ccontributing significantly\u201d to vaccine development both in this country and across the world. It had \u201cdirect investment in the work being progressed at the University of Queensland [UQ], investment in the capacity of the CSIRO, as well as ongoing contributions to the global efforts being coordinated by \u2026 Cepi\u201d. \u201cFurther, CSL has made a commitment that its dose allocation of the UQ vaccine will be used, at a minimum, to support its longstanding public health commitment to the Australian community.\u201d", "From reassurance to shambles: how Australia\u2019s coronavirus vaccine rollout unravelled [2021-04-09T20:00:47Z]": "Australia\u2019s vaccine rollout was dealt a blow on Thursday when the government announced that the Pfizer vaccine should be preferred for those under 50 due to concerns about extremely rare blood clotting events associated with the AstraZeneca product, which forms the backbone of Australia\u2019s vaccine strategy. \nThat news led the opposition to again focus on the government\u2019s failure to spread the risk by securing deals with other vaccine manufacturers such as Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson. But even before the rumblings over the AstraZeneca clotting events translated into official advice to limit the vaccine\u2019s distribution, the government was under pressure to explain why the vaccine rollout had fallen so far behind its initial rosy predictions. \n \n  Related: UK ministers silent on AstraZeneca vaccine shipment to Australia  \n \nThe government has blamed the delays on supply issues in Europe that are \u201coutside of Australia\u2019s control\u201d, as it remains in a dispute with the European Union over export approvals. \nBut until recent weeks messaging from ministers had been at pains to play down the significance of the European supply issues. \nHere is how the rhetoric has changed as the rollout strategy has gradually unravelled. \nSeptember \n7 September: Scott Morrison announces Australia\u2019s first vaccine deals, before any Covid-19 vaccines had finished final-stage testing or had been approved for use. \nMorrison said Australia would buy 33.8m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was still being developed at Oxford University. He said 3.8m would be imported, as early as January, with the remainder to be manufactured by CSL in Melbourne. \nThis announcement also included an intention to purchase 51m doses of the formula being developed at the University of Queensland. Both deals were contingent on the formulas passing trials. \nAustralia would also gain access to 25.5m doses of a successful vaccine candidate through the Covax facility \u2013 a global initiative to support research, development and production of vaccines. \nNovember \n5 November: The government announces it will purchase a further 50m doses of two other vaccines, contingent on their formulas being proved safe and effective \u2013 40m from Novavax and 10m doses from Pfizer. \nMorrison says: \u201cWe aren\u2019t putting all our eggs in one basket and we will continue to pursue further vaccines should our medical experts recommend them.\u201d \nDecember \n2 December: The British regulator rules the the Pfizer vaccine is safe for use, and by 8 December, the UK administers the first post-trial dose of the Pfizer vaccine in the world. \n11 December: The UQ trials are abandoned after participants returned false positive test results for HIV, and the government terminates its agreement for the 51m doses it had ordered. \nAs a result, Australia plans to increase its reliance on the AstraZeneca vaccine, from 33.8m to 53.8m doses, with the extra 20m to be locally produced. It also announces an extra 11 million doses of the Novavax vaccine. \nWith purchase agreements in place for 140m doses, health minister Greg Hunt says Australia is \u201cin a strong position\u201d. \n\u201cThis is one of the highest ratios of vaccine purchases and availability to population in the world,\u201d Hunt says. \n \n  Related: Some South Australian aged care workers denied second Pfizer Covid vaccine shot   \n \nNo specific dates are set for Australia\u2019s first vaccinations, but the government indicates they will begin in March. \n28 December: Hunt says the vaccine rollout is running ahead of schedule, and will be completed by the end of October, as opposed to the previous target of the end of 2021. He reiterates that the jab will be voluntary. \n30 December: Britain\u2019s regulator approves the AstraZeneca vaccine for use. Australian health authorities had defended the slower regulatory approvals process of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, noting foreign governments were granting emergency approvals as they were faced with escalating outbreaks. \nJanuary \n4 January: The first AstraZeneca vaccine is administered in the UK. \n5 January: Asked on 3AW radio why Australia\u2019s approvals process and rollout is so much slower, Morrison says: \u201cAustralia is not in an emergency situation like the United Kingdom, so we don\u2019t have to cut corners. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to take unnecessary risks.\u201d \n6 January: After sustained calls from Labor to accelerate approvals, Hunt suggests Australia will bring forward the first vaccinations from late March to early March. \n7 January: The government unveils its comprehensive phased plan for the rollout, which includes starting vaccinations even earlier, in mid-to-late February. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nThe rollout plan includes targets of administering 4m doses by the end of March, as well as an aim to have the Pfizer vaccine approved by the TGA by late January, and AstraZeneca by February. \n22 January: Morrison first mentions that international demand and supply issues from vaccine producers could delay Australia\u2019s rollout. \n\u201cThese things you know are very conditional upon the supply arrangements coming out of Pfizer in particular. As you know though, we took the decision to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine here in Australia so we\u2019d be less hostage to those international supply arrangements. So that is very dependent on those arrangements. And I know there\u2019s a lot of pressure on that group at the moment,\u201d he tells 4BC radio. \n\u201cI was speaking to a lot of European leaders at the start of this week, and there\u2019s been some pressure on the supplies there. So look, we\u2019ve just got to work with that.\u201d \nAt a national cabinet meeting later that day, Morrison is unable to tell state and territory leaders how many Pfizer vaccines will be received by mid-February. \n25 January: The TGA approves the Pfizer vaccine for use in Australia. At a press conference, Morrison says:  \u201cNo \u2026 vaccines destined for Australia have been diverted anywhere else \u2013 let me be clear about that.\u201d \n26 January: The European Union threatens to block exports of Covid-19 vaccines to countries outside the bloc, after AstraZeneca is accused of failing to give a satisfactory explanation for a huge shortfall of promised doses to member states. \nThe Morrison government said it still expected the AstraZeneca vaccine to be rolled out in March and that the threat wouldn\u2019t lead to any shortfalls. \nOn 29 January, the European Commission agreed to an export control plan, which requires vaccine manufacturers to request export authorisation in the EU country where the vaccine was produced. Under the plan, the EC must approve each export. \n \n  Related: Risk, reward and the AstraZeneca vaccine \u2013 podcast  \n \nBy this point, AstraZeneca had advised the Australian government that it could deliver 500,000 of the vaccine doses in February and 700,000 in March. \nGreg Hunt said the government would approach the World Health Organization and the EU to ensure its supply. \n28 January: CSL executives decline to appear before the parliamentary Covid committee, saying the company is not available because it is \u201ccurrently fully focussed on the accelerated manufacture\u201d of the AstraZeneca vaccine. It says it hopes to provide 1m vaccine doses a week by late March. \nFebruary \n4 February: Australia secures an additional 10m doses of the Pfizer vaccine, taking the country\u2019s total order to 20m. \n15 February: The first shipment of Pfizer vaccine arrives in Australia. \n16 February: The TGA approves the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in Australia. \n21 February: Australia administers its first Pfizer dose, with Scott Morrison also receiving his jab in front of media. \n28 February: 300,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine land in Sydney. Later reports suggest this order came from the UK, not from the EU. After the initial shipment, AstraZeneca applies to the EU to export a further 500,000 doses from Italy to Australia, Morrison says. \nMarch \n3 March: The EU advises AstraZeneca to resubmit its application and ask for only 250,000 doses, a temporary reduction that Morrison agrees to. \n5 March: As Australia\u2019s first AstraZeneca vaccine is administered, the government learns that the EU has blocked the export request for the reduced order of 250,000 doses. Hunt asks for the decision to be reviewed. \nSeeking to quash concerns about the impact of the decision, Morrison says: \u201cThis particular shipment was not one we\u2019d counted on for the rollout, and so we will continue unabated.\u201d \nHunt goes further, suggesting Australia does not need more than the 300,000 AstraZeneca doses it has already received to continue its rollout without delay. \nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n  \n \n\u201cWe are very clear that this does not affect the pace of the rollout. That shipment had not been factored in to our distribution to the states and territories. And in fact we received the first shipment of AstraZeneca this week of 300,000 doses,\u201d Hunt says. \n\u201cSo, we had planned the AstraZeneca rollout based solely on those 300,000 doses that had arrived in Australia, and we were very, very cautious on that front, and so there are more than enough to see that bridge through to the arrival of the Australian-made CSL AstraZeneca doses.\u201d \nThe government later says the EU by now had signalled the same supply issues would lead it to block further export requests. \n11 March: The government walks away from its promise to fully vaccinate all Australians by October. \n19 March: Morrison pleads with the EU to redirect 1m of the doses Australia had ordered to Papua New Guinea \u2013 which is grappling with its coronavirus outbreak \u2013 as the EU\u2019s export control excludes vaccines destined for low and middle income countries. \n \n  Related: How long before Australia is fully vaccinated against Covid?  \n \n22 March: CSL completes production of its first batch of AstraZeneca vaccines. \nBy the end of March, Australia has administered nearly 600,000 doses, 3.4m short of its target for the end of the month, as local doctors who joined the rollout complain of a lack of supply and organisation. \nHunt asks AstraZeneca to resubmit an export application to the European Union. \nApril \n6 April: Facing questions about the delays in the rollout, Morrison says the situation in Europe has \u201cfrustrated\u201d supply and caused delays. \n\u201cThe supply is the major restraint and always has been, whether it\u2019s been the non-delivery of vaccines from overseas, some three million that we were relying upon \u2026They\u2019re circumstances that are outside Australia\u2019s control,\u201d he says. \nThis marks a shift from Hunt\u2019s remarks on 5 March that Australia did not require more than the 300,000 foreign AstraZeneca doses it had already received. \nThe EU hits back at Morrison for suggesting it had blocked all 3.1m doses not yet delivered, pointing out it had only blocked one shipment. The government then accuses the EU of \u201carguing semantics\u201d, noting the body had signalled it would not approve further exports, so it had not asked AstraZeneca to submit requests. \nMorrison renews calls for the EU to allow the outstanding doses to be shipped to Australia, including a pledge to give 1m to PNG. \n7 April: CSL has still not reached its million dose per week production target set by the government. \nAs of 7 April, 1.3m doses have been released from CSL, while the number of imported AstraZeneca doses remains at 717,000. Australia has received 870,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from overseas. About 920,000 vaccine doses have been administered. \nHunt says he expects 1.62m doses to be produced by CSL and cleared for distribution by \u201cearly\u201d in the week beginning 19 April. \n8 April: In a hastily-called evening press conference, it is announced that under-50s should be given the Pfizer vaccine in preference to AstraZeneca as a result of the rare blood-clotting cases. \n \n  Related: Tens of thousands of Australians left in the lurch as AstraZeneca Covid vaccine advice changes  \n \nThe advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation says: \u201cUntil the government can increase supply of Covid-19 vaccines other than AstraZeneca, overall coverage under Australia\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine program will likely be reduced. This will likely impact the time frame to which the Australian population is protected against Covid-19.\u201d \n9 April: Following a national cabinet meeting, Morrison announces Australia has secured a further 20m doses of the Pfizer vaccine taking the total to 40m. The newly ordered doses are expected to be available in the final quarter of 2021. \nMorrison acknowledges Australia\u2019s vaccine rollout will likely push into 2022. Asked if he could guarantee all Australians would receive at least their first dose of a vaccine by Christmas, Morrison says \u201cwe\u2019re not in a position at the moment to reconfirm a timetable\u201d. \nThe opposition health spokesman, Mark Butler, offers this assessment: \u201cFrankly, this government put too many of their eggs in a single basket and now we are paying the price.\u201d", "\u2018Simmering under the surface\u2019: how anger has overtaken anxiety amid Australia\u2019s Covid outbreaks [2021-08-13T20:00:20Z]": "Shelley didn\u2019t consider herself an angry person.

Those \u201cconsumed with worry about loss of income, those that are isolated from any support systems \u2013 I could say get a hobby, listen to music or exercise\u201d, Kirby says. \u201cBut for someone who can\u2019t pay the rent week to week, a message like that can make you even angrier \u2013 you\u2019re not heard, you\u2019re not recognised.\u201d That\u2019s when utilising services like free counselling services become imperative, he says. And if we do blow up, we should be ready to forgive ourselves and focus on repair. After nearly two years of dealing with a global pandemic, we might be angry some of the time but we\u2019re most definitely tired all of the time, and it is possible to be both. \u201cOh gosh, yes!\u201d says Steindl. \u201cAnger, the threat system and the sympathetic nervous system are absolutely exhausting. If you think about it, our bodies are in a constant state of emergency \u2026 It\u2019s like we\u2019re running a marathon \u2026 so we are very tired, but then can\u2019t sleep at night \u2026 Our resources get depleted, and we are less able to cope with all the stress. It is a very vicious cycle.\u201d Shelley is most definitely in the exhausted camp. So most nights she channels her anger into a highly effective therapy session. \u201cI photoshop genitals on to the faces of politicians and send them to friends.

The other thing that we know is that the incubation period for this particular strain is very short, and it can be down to 24 hours.\u201d A more infectious strain of the disease would be concerning, due to the potential for more rapid spread and implications for the efficacy of vaccines. Marshall told ABC radio: \u201cThe elements of this are quite frightening \u2026 It\u2019s quite different than anything we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d What evidence is there that this strain is more infectious? Dr Adam Taylor, an emerging viruses researcher with the Menzies Health Institute Queensland, said without sequencing the genetic material of the virus circulating in the South Australian outbreak, not much could be said about whether this was actually a unique, infectious strain. The evidence \u2013 that it has a very short incubation period, is sometimes transmitted from surfaces, and displays no symptoms for some people who become infected \u2013 are all characteristics of the major virus strain circulating globally, he said.   Related: South Australia officials reject calls to stop Covid medi-hotel staff working multiple jobs    \u201cTo have a completely new strain requires mutations in the virus genome to cause changes in the way the virus interacts with its hosts and the environment,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cOnly through sequencing the virus responsible for this outbreak and subsequently studying its behaviour in the lab will we begin to understand the virus at the centre of the South Australian outbreak.\u201d Taylor said this did not mean that authorities were wrong about the outbreak being serious and concerning. \u201cBut the characteristics they describe, such as \u2018highly contagious\u2019, may be a result of how the virus is interacting with humans, rather than a change in the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, the rapid spread of the virus in this outbreak may be due to a super-spreader event, possibly centred on the pizza parlour. This is a more likely scenario than the rise of a new virus strain. Until we see the genome sequence of the virus and confirm its behaviour experimentally, we cannot be sure we\u2019re dealing with a new strain.\u201d Guardian Australia asked the South Australian health department for clarification of Marshall\u2019s comments and the evidence it is based on, but is yet to receive a response. But a professor of infectious diseases and immunology at Griffith University, Nigel McMillan, said: \u201cThere is no genomic data for the scientific community to verify such a claim, where a new strain has a specific definition.\u201d So why is Marshall saying it is a more infectious strain? \u201cWhat\u2019s happening I think is similar to what happened with the Crossroads Hotel outbreak in New South Wales,\u201d says infectious diseases physician and professor with the Kirby Institute Gregory Dore. In July the NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said of the Crossroads Hotel outbreak: \u201cWhat\u2019s been interesting is we\u2019ve seen some acquisition which has been very short. So people have developed the symptoms more towards the one-day period than the 14.\u201d  The comments were similar to those made by Marshall on Thursday. But Dore said if health authorities identified a cluster and as a result rapidly began to test and contact trace a significant number of people, they would also pick up asymptomatic cases and people who were only recently infected. This skews the data to make it seem like people are becoming infected more quickly. \u201cThe strategy in South Australia is right. I\u2019m really supportive of that great contact tracing and isolating contacts and doing widespread testing and asymptomatic testing,\u201d Dore said. \u201cBut the results are not that reflective of some sneaky strain suddenly launching itself upon South Australians. Now it will be a slightly different strain most likely to the one in Victoria as viruses do change and it has probably come from a different country.    Related: South Australia announces six-day Covid lockdown as \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 to avoid second wave    \u201cBut globally there haven\u2019t been huge shifts between strains to the extent that makes some more virulent or pathogenic. In fact this virus actually seems to change more slowly than the flu. That\u2019s good news for a vaccine for Covid-19.\u201d What do we know about Covid strains circulating across the world? \u201cFor now, SARS-CoV-2 and its variants can still be considered as a single \u2018virus\u2019,\u201d a virologist at the UQ child health research centre at the University of Queensland, Associate Prof Ian Mackay, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like all of the world\u2019s human genetic diversity still sitting under the umbrella of one species.  \u201cMost of what we read about in terms of \u2018new strains\u2019 is mostly about small genetic and sometimes amino acid [affecting the protein] changes, the impact of which is either unknown or not obvious.\u201d But he said as the virus spread in different areas it continued to evolve and so vigilance was essential.", "Portugal reports record daily deaths; Londoners urged to follow rules \u2013 as it happened [2020-12-12T00:38:16Z]": " \n  1.05am GMT  \n  \n  This blog is now closed.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the number of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic was surging and urged people to think very carefully about their holiday season plans. \n   \n   \n   Brazil\u2019s health ministry is studying 58 suspected cases of Covid-19 reinfection after confirming the first case of a person getting reinfected with coronavirus, a ministry spokeswoman said. The first case was a health worker in the northern city of Natal, a 37-year-old woman who tested positive in June and again 116 days later in October, the ministry said on Thursday. \n   \n   \n   Indoor dining restrictions will be reinstated indefinitely in New York City, governor Andrew Cuomo announced as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continue climbing in the city and throughout the state. \n   \n   \n   The UK reported 424 new Covid-related deaths on Friday, as the number of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital increased week on week. \n   \n   \n   Portugal reported 95 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Friday, its worst daily toll since the pandemic started. The country of just over 10 million people has now reported 5,373 deaths and a total of 340,287 infections, up by 5,080 cases from Thursday. \n   \n   \n   The level 3 coronavirus restrictions placed on the city of Edinburgh in Scotland have not been suspended by a judge, who decided the Scottish government had a right to consider factors other than data. \n   \n   \n   Rapid coronavirus tests rolled out in Liverpool in England missed more than half of those who had Covid-19, preliminary data suggests. \n   \n   \n   There were no cases of severe allergic reactions to Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine candidate during clinical trials, a Pfizer executive said at a regulatory conference. \n   \n   \n   Switzerland has ordered restaurants, bars and shops to close down from 7pm across much of the nation, the government said on Friday, as the country continues to face a persistently high level of Covid-19 infections and deaths. \n   \n   \n   Scientists have identified mutations in five genes associated with the development of life-threatening illness in patients with Covid-19.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.19pm GMT \n \n \n  8.55pm GMT  \n  \n  There were no cases of severe allergic reactions to Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine candidate during clinical trials, a Pfizer executive said at a regulatory conference.  A late-stage trial testing the potential vaccine excluded participants who had a prior history of severe allergic reactions to any vaccine or to the constituents of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, said Dr William Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development.  \n   \n   We\u2019ve not had any anaphylactic episodes related to the vaccine,\u201d Gruber said during a panel meeting of independent advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n   \n  The trial included about 6,000 participants respectively in both the vaccine and placebo groups with a history of a range of allergic conditions like pollen allergy, food allergy, all the way up to anaphylaxis, Pfizer executive Susan Mather said.  Anaphylaxis is an overreaction by the body\u2019s immune system that could sometimes be life-threatening.  The comments follow British medicine regulators\u2019 advice that people with a history of significant allergic reactions do not get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, after two people reported adverse effects.  The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue an emergency use authorisation for the two-dose vaccine as soon as Friday, according to the New York Times.  Once authorised, the first Americans could be immunized as soon as Monday or Tuesday, with healthcare workers expected to be among the first in line.  \n  \n Updated at 9.20pm GMT \n \n \n  8.47pm GMT  \n  \n  The level 3 coronavirus restrictions placed on the city of Edinburgh in Scotland have not been suspended by a judge, who decided the Scottish government had a right to consider factors other than data.  Lord Ericht passed a judicial review on the motion from KLR &amp; RCR International Ltd &amp; Others after hospitality businesses in the city warned of the further impact the measures could have.  \n  At a remote hearing on Friday, Dean of Faculty Roddy Dunlop QC, on behalf of the petitioners, told the judge the level 3 decision made for Edinburgh by Scottish government ministers was \u201cflawed\u201d and did not reflect Public Health Scotland advice or case figures.  \n  James Mure QC, representing ministers, said while the data was there to inform the decision-makers, there was \u201cno simple algorithm\u201d to determine levels and the indicators used \u201cmay change over time\u201d. \n  In his judgment, Lord Ericht said: \u201cThe current coronavirus crisis has brought difficult challenges. \n  \u201cIt has brought particularly difficult challenges to the hospitality industry.  \n   \n   I have been provided with information and affidavits about the devastating effect on the businesses of the petitioners and the consequences for their survival if they have to operate on level 3 rather than level 2 restrictions over the festive period.\u201d  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.22pm GMT \n \n \n  8.32pm GMT  \n  \n  \n Updated at 8.37pm GMT \n \n \n  8.23pm GMT  \n  \n  The president of the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF), Augustin Senghor, said he feared for sport in his country due to coronavirus restrictions.  \n  On Thursday, the west African state announced that the ban on public gatherings, including sports training, will remain in place.  \n  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that if it\u2019s put in place or renewed, it\u2019s a death warrant for Senegalese sport,\u201d Senghor said on the FSF\u2019s Facebook page.  \n  \u201cOne year or more without playing sport in a country becomes worrying. We need to play because it\u2019s good for public health and our young people,\u201d he added.  \n  Senghor also questioned why some countries which have been hit harder by the pandemic have allowed sport to continue.  \n  Senegal has declared 16,173 cases of Covid-19 with 334 deaths from the virus.  \n  \n Updated at 9.23pm GMT \n \n \n  8.04pm GMT  \n  \n  Rapid coronavirus tests rolled out in Liverpool in England missed more than half of those who had Covid-19, preliminary data suggests.  \n  A document released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday shows the tests missed about 51% of all cases.  \n  The paper considered by Sage on 26 November said that two days earlier the Liverpool Health Protection Board had decided to pause plans to use the Innova lateral flow test to allow care home visits because they were not accurate enough.  \n  One week later the government started sending out the tests to England\u2019s biggest care homes.  \n  On 5 December the chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace defended the uses of the tests, despite concerns around the accuracy.  \n  Dr Susan Hopkins said the tests had enabled them to find many cases of infection in people without Covid-19 symptoms that would otherwise have been missed.  \n  She explained the programme was about case detection, and people with a negative test were not being told they did not have the disease.  \n  Instead it was identifying those who do have Covid-19, and telling them to isolate.  \n  Prof Richard Tedder, senior research investigator in medical virology, Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe data presented on the performance of the Innova lateral flow assay for detecting Sars-CoV-2 clearly indicate in this study that when compared against a benchmark molecular test such as a quantitative PCR the lateral flow test is very very much less sensitive, detecting only about half of the known positive samples subjected to testing.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 8.14pm GMT \n \n \n  7.52pm GMT  \n  \n  Britain\u2019s Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, took their three young children to a special pantomime performance on Friday to meet and thank healthworkers, delivery drivers and volunteers for their efforts during the pandemic.  \n  Prince William delivered a short speech to thank the workers from across Britain who had supported communities and battled to keep the country operating earlier this year. \n  The couple embarked on a short national tour earlier this week to meet and thank frontline workers, care home staff and teachers for their efforts during the pandemic. \n  On Friday the couple arrived walking down a red carpet with their three young children \u2013 George, Charlotte and Louis \u2013 who stopped to watch actors dressed as elves waving and juggling.  \n  They later watched the performance staring the actor and comedian Julian Clary and singer Elaine Paige.  \n  \n Updated at 8.16pm GMT \n \n \n  7.36pm GMT  \n  \n  The World Health Organization warned that Christmas celebrations could turn to \u201csadness\u201d if people fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 during the festive season. \n  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the number of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic was surging and urged people to think very carefully about their holiday season plans. \n  \u201cThe festive season is a time to relax and celebrate but... celebration can very quickly turn to sadness if we fail to take the right precautions,\u201d he told a news conference. \n   \n   As you prepare to celebrate over the coming weeks, please, please consider your plans carefully. If you live in an area with high transmission, please take every precaution to keep yourselves and others safe. \n   \u201cThat could be the best gift you could give - the gift of health.\u201d \n   Tedros said there had been a 60 percent increase worldwide in deaths from the respiratory disease over the past six weeks. \n   However, some continents are witnessing bigger death toll surges than others, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19.  \n   She said there had been nearly a 100 percent increase in the number of deaths per week in the WHO\u2019s Europe region over the past six weeks, a 54 percent increase in the Americas and 50 percent in Africa.  \n   \n   \u201cThis virus is still circulating. Most of the world remains at risk,\u201d she said. \n  \n Updated at 7.41pm GMT \n \n \n  7.27pm GMT  \n  \n  Some Spanish ski stations, including exclusive Baqueira Beret favoured by the royal family, are set to open from next week while observing nationwide coronavirus restrictions. \n  Ski resorts have become a divisive issue in Europe as some countries like France, Germany and Italy have shut them after some ski stations became Covid-19 breeding grounds last winter, helping the early spread of the illness in Europe. \n  Privately owned Baqueira Beret, in the Pyrenees near the French border, said on its website it will open on Monday, though it will limit the number of skiers to guarantee social distance. \n  \u201cThe starting shot of the winter 2020-2021 will be fired on December 14,\u201d the resort said on Friday. \n  Spain\u2019s Sierra Nevada resort in Andalusia said it will open to skiers next Friday. \n  Switzerland has said it will open its ski resorts. \n  Austria announced this month that skiing will be allowed from December 24th but hotels will stay closed until January 7th and visits from abroad will likely be much reduced given quarantine requirements for people from countries with more than 100 cases per 100,000 - which include Germany, France and Italy.  \n  Pyrenean microstate Andorra, whose economy relies heavily on winter sports, has not set a date yet for opening resorts but it will not be before January. \n  French Prime Minister Jean Castex said after ordering resorts in his country closed that police would make random border checks to prevent people leaving the country to go skiing in neighbouring countries. \n  Castex said after meeting with ski station representatives on Friday that the government was considering opening the resorts from January 7. \n  Spain\u2019s Aragon region, which also borders France, has not decided when - or if - the slopes will open before Christmas.  \n  \n Updated at 7.31pm GMT \n \n \n  7.15pm GMT  \n Brazil confirms first case of person being reinfected with Covid-19 \n  \n  Brazil\u2019s  health ministry is studying 58 suspected cases of Covid-19 re-infection after confirming the first case of a person getting re-infected with coronavirus, a ministry spokeswoman said. \n  The first case was a health worker in the northern city of Natal, a 37-year-old woman, who tested positive in June and again 116 days later in October, the ministry said on Thursday. \n  The re-infection was confirmed by the FioCruz biomedical research center in Rio de Janeiro, it said in a statement. \n  So far 58 suspected cases of re-infection have been reported and are being studied, the spokeswoman said. \n  The cases involve people who tested positive and their re-infection must be confirmed as a separate infection and not the re-appearance of the same infection, she said. \n  The FioCruz researcher who did the genetic sequencing of the infection of the case in Natal, Paola Resende, said it looked like the woman did not generate enough anti-bodies to avoid getting infected again more than 90 days later. \n  Resende told Reuters that the woman was infected by a separate strain of coronavirus the second time. \n   \n   The pathogen of the sample collected in June belonged to the B.1.1.33 strain and the October sample was from the B.1.1.28 strain. Both had already been detected in Brazil,\u201d she said.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.05pm GMT  \n  \n  Indoor dining restrictions will be reinstated indefinitely in New York City, governor Andrew Cuomo announced as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continue climbing in the city and throughout the state. \n  As of Monday, only takeout orders and outdoor dining will be allowed in the city, one of the world\u2019s great cuisine capitals, the governor said at a news conference in Albany. \n  The Democrat had been hinting at a clampdown on indoor dining for a week, saying he was waiting to see if hospitalization rates stabilized. \n  They have not, and Cuomo said that despite the economic pain to one of the city\u2019s biggest and most vital industries, he needed to act. \n  \u201cIn New York City, you put the CDC caution on indoor dining together with the rate of transmission and the density and the crowding, that is a bad situation,\u201d he said. \n   \n   \n    As #COVID19 indicators continue to rise, it\u2019s time to shut down indoor dining. This is painful. So many restaurants are struggling. But we can\u2019t allow this virus to reassert itself in our city. I fully support @NYGovCuomo's decision. Together we'll fight back this second wave. https://t.co/NWY9xmjGdh\u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) December 11, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.52pm GMT  \n UK reports 424 further Covid-related deaths, slightly fewer than the day before \n  \n  The UK reported 424 new Covid-related deaths on Friday, as the number of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital increased week on week. \n  The government\u2019s Covid dashboard showed: \n   \n   21,672 people tested positive in the last 24 hours. \n   1,622 people were admitted to hospital overnight. \n   10,194 people were hospitalised with Covid in the last week, 560 more than the previous week (a rise of 5.8%). \n   There were 1,267 Coronavirus patients needing help breathing with a mechanical ventilator on 10 December. \n   119,025 people tested positive in the last week, a 17.7% increase from the previous week. \n   2,906 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test last week, 5.3% fewer than the previous week. \n   Between 23 March and 7 December 2020, there have been 232,898 people who have had to go into hospital with coronavirus. \n   Between 31 January and 11 December 2020, there have been 1,809,455 people who have had a confirmed positive test result. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.03pm GMT \n \n \n  6.27pm GMT  \n  \n  France reported 13,406 new coronavirus infections on Friday, fewer than Thursday\u2019s 13,750 but well above the 11,221 reported last Friday, while intensive care cases dropped again and are now well below a government target. \n  After falling for weeks following the November lockdown, early December\u2019s partial easing has led to an increase in infection rates and the daily count has not dropped to the 5,000 set by the government as a precondition for further loosening. \n  But the number of people in intensive care - the most important measure of a health system\u2019s ability to deal with the disease - dropped again by 75 to 2,884 and is now well within the government target level of 2,500 to 3,000, health ministry data showed. \n  The total case count since the start of the pandemic rose to 2.35 million, while the number of deaths rose by 627 to 57,567. Friday\u2019s reported toll included 304 hospital deaths, compared to 292 on Thursday, and a three-day batch of 323 retirement home deaths. \n  On Thursday, the French government postponed a further planned easing of lockdown measures by three weeks and said that an 8pm curfew from15 December would remain in place for New Year\u2019s eve but will be waived for Christmas.  \n  \n \n \n  6.25pm GMT  \n  \n  In London, police have criticised \u201cselfish\u201d people for holding parties, large weddings and unlicensed music events as the city faces rising coronavirus cases. \n  High infection rates mean the UK capital could be headed for tier 3 restrictions. London has increasing infection rates, according to the latest official figures. \n  In an effort to tackle the Covid spread in London, thousands of extra tests are being made available for schools in areas of concern. \n  The mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has said London going into tier 3 would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for hospitality in the capital, has introduced new measures \u201cto try to turn the tide of rising case numbers\u201d. \n  These include expanding community testing with 10 extra mobile testing units and up to 30 additional police officers this weekend. \n  Downing Street has warned Londoners to be \u201cvigilant\u201d to control the spread of the virus. \n  A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cWe would encourage people to remain vigilant and to adhere to local restrictions and to follow the social distancing rules that are in place.\u201d \n  The Metropolitan police said almost 40 attendees at a wedding had been reported for fines earlier this week in an area with a high infection rate, and that the organiser now faces a potential \u00a310,000 fine. \n  The force said its officers have also broken up unlicensed music events and made arrests at protests, as well as at central London shopping areas where people have failed to follow the regulations.A small number of arrests were made after hundreds of young people were photographed gathering outside the world-famous Harrods department store last Saturday, the first weekend since England\u2019s national lockdown was lifted. \n  The deputy assistant commissioner Matt Twist, the Met\u2019s lead for Covid-19 operations, said: \u201cIt is really saddening that in the week a vaccine finally began its rollout to the most vulnerable, offering a ray of hope to us all, that we are facing the possibility of tougher restrictions. \n  \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid the infection rates show not all of us are being careful enough.\u201d \n  He said \u201ccollective actions\u201d in the days and weeks ahead \u201cwill have very serious consequences\u201d and warned that if people do not change their behaviour now \u201cthen people will die who could have otherwise lived \u2013 it\u2019s that simple\u201d. \n  He added: \u201cWe will not allow the irresponsible and selfish actions of a few jeopardise the safety of the entire city, but we also urge everyone to ensure they too are taking personal responsibility to do all they can to protect themselves and their community.\u201d \n  Speaking at a session of the London assembly, the police commissioner, Cressida Dick, praised the \u201cheroism and dedication\u201d of Met officers in the face of challenges caused by the pandemic. \n  \u201cMy officers obviously don\u2019t know when they go into a house whether someone has had Covid,\u201d she said. \n  \u201cThey have been dealing with the deceased, sadly, to support families where people have died of Covid. \n  \u201cIt\u2019s been a very different year for us in the way in which we work.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  6.08pm GMT  \n Portugal reports record number of daily deaths \n  \n  Portugal reported 95 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Friday, its worst daily toll since the pandemic started. \n  The figures \u2014 from the national DGS health authority \u2014 came a week before the government is expected to re-evaluate plans to ease restrictions over the Christmas period. \n  The country of just over 10 million people has now reported 5,373 deaths and a total of 340,287 infections, up by 5,080 cases from Thursday. \n  After a relatively mild first wave, cases rose sharply in the second, though they have eased slightly recently. \n  The number of infections per 100,000 people measured over the past 14 days is, at 533, more than double that in neighbouring Spain, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control showed. \n  The government said on Saturday it would ease coronavirus rules over Christmas to let people visit loved ones, but added it would keep checking the data and reevaluate its plans on 18 December, Reuters reported.  \n  \n Updated at 6.09pm GMT \n \n \n  5.19pm GMT  \n  \n  A further 275 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 43,812, NHS England said on Friday. \n  Patients were aged between 34 and 99. All except eight, aged between 60 and 95, had known underlying health conditions. \n  The deaths were between November 1 and December 10. \n  \n \n \n  4.10pm GMT  \n Genetic mutations discovered which could aid Covid treatments \n  \n  Scientists have identified mutations in five genes associated with the development of life-threatening illness in patients with Covid-19. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus: UK scientists identify drugs that may help severe cases  \n   \n  UK researchers said their work, published in the journal Nature, sheds light on the mechanisms that underpin severe coronavirus symptoms and could lead to potential new drug treatments for the disease. \n  Dr Kenneth Baillie, the project\u2019s chief investigator and senior research fellow at University of Edinburgh\u2019s Roslin Institute, said: \u201cThis is a stunning realisation of the promise of human genetics to help understand critical illness... \n  \u201cOur results immediately highlight which drugs should be at the top of the list for clinical testing. We can only test a few drugs at a time, so making the right choices will save thousands of lives.\u201d \n  Dr Baillie and his team performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,244 critically-ill patients with Covid-19 from 208 intensive care units (ICU) in the UK. \n  GWAS is a commonly used study design which allows scientists to identify which genes are involved in human disease. \n  Working with experts from the GenOMICC consortium, a global collaboration looking into the links between genetics and critical illness, the researchers compared the genetic information of Covid-19 patients in ICU with samples provided by healthy volunteers from other studies. \n  The team found that variations in five genes - Ifnar2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9 and CCR2 - was associated with the development of severe illness in Covid-19 patients. \n  The scientists said that they were able to pinpoint two molecular processes \u2013 antiviral immunity and lung inflammation \u2013 associated with the genes. \n  Innate antiviral defences are known to be important early in the disease while the inflammatory processes triggered by the infection are a key feature of severe Covid-19, the researchers said. \n  But the team said the research was not aimed at predicting who is likely to get critically ill with Covid-19 but focuses more on finding \u201cbiological clues that will lead us to effective treatments\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 5.28pm GMT \n \n \n  3.55pm GMT  \n  \n  Restrictions on non-essential travel between Mexico and the US could be extended until 21 January, following a proposal by the Mexican government. \n  Mexico has proposed to the US that restrictions on non-essential travel at their shared border be extended for another month as authorities continue to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, the Mexican foreign ministry said on Friday. \n  \n Updated at 4.05pm GMT \n \n \n  3.36pm GMT  \n  \n  Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi have said their potential Covid-19 vaccine won\u2019t be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot\u2019s effectiveness in older people, AP is reporting. \n  The companies said early trials showed the vaccine produced an \u201cinsufficient\u201d immune response in people over 60 because it didn\u2019t contain enough of the material that triggers the production of disease-fighting antibodies.  \n  They said they plan to reformulate the vaccine and do more testing, which is likely to delay approval to the fourth quarter of 2021 from the middle of the year. \n  \u201cThe results of the study are not as we hoped,\u201d Roger Connor, president of London-based GSK Vaccines, said in a statement. \n  The delay is a setback for plans to vaccinate large numbers of people around the world amid a pandemic that has already taken more than 1.5 million lives.  \n  GSK and Sanofi plan to produce up to 1bn doses of their Covid-19 vaccine annually, and they have signed agreements to supply millions of doses to the US, European Union, Canada and developing countries. \n  The difficulties underscore the challenges scientists face as they race to develop Covid-19 vaccines, condensing a process that usually takes years into a matter of months.  \n  Public health experts say several vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, because of the challenges in rapidly producing and distributing enough doses to vaccinate billions of people. \n  \n Updated at 3.51pm GMT \n \n \n  3.20pm GMT  \n  \n  Companies in the US are considering various options to get employees back to work after the Covid vaccine has been rolled out, Reuters is reporting. \n  Options on the table include giving workers a choice between a free vaccine and a cash bonus if everyone gets inoculated, to being reassigned or even losing your job. \n  Keen to avoid a backlash or violating the law, companies are discussing options with lawyers, health care experts and polling their workers to gauge when to offer carrots and when to use a stick. \n  Workplace programmes could come following US approval of the first vaccine this week. But a Pew Research poll shows 21% of Americans are firmly opposed, with 60% likely to get a shot.  \n  Among big employers starting to formulate policies are oil giant Chevron Corp, auto maker Ford Motor Co, retailer Target Corp, restaurant chain Ford\u2019s Garage, the United Steelworkers union, and refiners\u2019 Marathon Petroleum and Citgo Petroleum. \n  Their efforts are preliminary given FDA vaccine approvals remain outstanding. \n  Experts say that private employers could set up mandatory vaccinations so long as they exempt workers with religious and medical conditions, while the direct threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic will allow mandatory programs to win approvals soon. \n  \n Updated at 3.51pm GMT \n \n \n  3.00pm GMT  \n  \n  Australia has cancelled the production of a locally made vaccine against Covid-19 after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis, Reuters is reporting.  \n  The government has instead securing additional doses of rival vaccines. \n  Antibodies generated by the vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland (UQ) and biotech firm CSL, one of four candidates contracted by the Australian government, were found to lead to some false positive HIV test results, the makers said. \n  While the vaccine had elicited a \u201crobust\u201d immune response to the novel Sars-COV-2 virus without serious adverse effects in a Phase 1 trial with 216 participants, re-engineering a fix could take another 12 months, they said. \n  CSL and the Australian government had together decided to stop Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. \n  \u201cWhile this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone\u2019s priority,\u201d said UQ professor Paul Young. \n  CSL, which had a contract to produce 51 million doses of the UQ vaccine, will instead produce an extra 20 million doses of the Oxford vaccine being developed with Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca, taking the total to 53 million. \n  The government said it has also secured additional doses of Novavax vaccines. \n  Australia also has a contract for 10 million doses of a vaccine being developed by Pfizer, with regulatory approval expected by January 2021. \n  \n Updated at 3.52pm GMT \n \n \n  2.29pm GMT  \n  \n  All school pupils aged 14-16 in Sweden\u2019s capital Stockholm will switch to remote learning for the rest of this year to help stem a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. \n  It is the first time Sweden, known as one of the rare Western countries to eschew mandatory lockdowns and masks in response to the pandemic, has recommended distance education for significant numbers of secondary school students. \n  \u201cWe must drastically reduce our contacts, so unfortunately I am forced to recommend that (Stockholm region) municipalities end on-site teaching for students in advanced stage education starting on Monday,\u201d regional infections control chief Maria Rotzen Ostlund said in a statement. \n  Stockholm has been the Swedish region hardest hit by the Covid-19 respiratory disease, accounting for more than a third of the Nordic country\u2019s death toll from the virus. \n  A further 7,370 new coronavirus cases were registered nationwide on Friday, Health Agency statistics showed, down from 7,935 new infections recorded on Thursday. \n  An additional 160 deaths were reported, one of the highest daily numbers since the start of the pandemic, taking the total to 7,514. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns.  \n  \n \n \n  2.05pm GMT  \n  \n  Covid has opened up - and exacerbated - all sorts of divides in societies around the world. In England, there has been a deepening of longstanding north-south divisions, which has seen most of the north put under the tightest Covid restrictions and most of the south spared the same pain. \n  Today the UK government announced a targeted testing drive for secondary school and college students in parts of north-east London, Essex and Kent. London and Essex are in tier 2, while Kent is in tier 3, the highest level of restrictions. \n  Most of the north of England is still in tier 3 but the offer has not been extended to schools there. Nor was the offer there in October and November, when rates there were the highest in the country \u2014 at one point in mid-November one in four children in Hull were off school because of outbreaks. \n  Jonathan Reynolds, the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, which has seen the highest Covid death rate across the whole pandemic, said teachers were \u201clivid\u201d at the government\u2019s southerncentric approach. He said the region had bid for school testing kits, but wasn\u2019t automatically offered any, as in London and the south-east. \n   \n   \n    I just able to discuss this with @AndyBurnhamGM as schools in my area are livid, and the good news is we already have a bid to Govt that includes this and we may well get it first. Good news but unfortunately it\u2019s another example of poor communication from Govt @helenpidd https://t.co/rbLOMsdXFY\u2014 Jonathan Reynolds (@jreynoldsMP) December 11, 2020\n    \n   \n  The Guardian asked the department of health and social care (DHSC) why London and the south-east seemed to be getting preferential treatment in terms of school testing allocation, and received this response: \n   \n   The evidence shows us there is a clear rise in cases in secondary school age children in these areas and we must act to target these rates - about one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and will be spreading it without realising it. \n   Our recent pilots in Liverpool have shown rapid testing is effective and can help us quickly assess where the virus is spreading most and take action to stop it in its tracks. \n   Local Authorities in tier 3 can apply for national support and funding for community testing to target high case rates.\u201d \n   \n  Local authorities in tier 3 areas, the highest level of restrictions, have been invited to apply for the new six-week community testing programme to complement wider local strategies to tackle the virus, and drive down submissions. \n  Since mid-November Directors of Public Health across the country have been able to receive 10,000 rapid tests to cut transmission rates, applying tests how they see fit in their communities. \n  \n \n \n  1.37pm GMT  \n UK: R value rises slightly to between 0.9 and 1 \n  \n  The reproduction number, or R value, of coronavirus transmission across the UK is now between 0.9 and 1, the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said. \n  Last week, the R number was between 0.8 and 1. \n  R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. \n  An R number between 0.9 and 1 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 9 and 10 other people. \n  Meanwhile, the R value in England is between 0.8 and 1, but Sage said it is not confident that R is below 1 in all English regions, particularly in London and parts of the South East. \n  \n Updated at 3.52pm GMT \n \n \n  1.19pm GMT  \n 7pm curfew introduced in Switzerland \n  \n  Switzerland has ordered restaurants, bars and shops to close down from 7pm across much of the nation, the government said on Friday, as the country continues to face a persistently high level of Covid-19 infections and deaths. \n  The government said regions less badly hit by the pandemic would still be allowed to have locations open until 11pm, in the measures which go into effect on Saturday. \n  The exception would apply to cantons that had a virus reproduction rate below 1 and an infection incidence below the national average over at least a week. \n  The measures, decided after discussions between the government and local authorities, also affect events and cultural activities which have been restricted to groups of five people. \n  \u201cThe level of infections with the coronavirus remains high and in some cantons is rising again,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cHospitals are close to their limits and health personnel are under pressure. The situation is disturbing.\u201d \n  On Friday, authorities reported 5,136 new cases and 106 more deaths in Switzerland and neighbouring principality Liechtenstein. \n  Switzerland has been trying to steer a middle course between shutting down the economy and preventing the spread of the virus. \n  But so far the strategy has had mixed results, with the number of infections much higher than during the first outbreak in March and April. Infection rates have once again begun to rise, after a drop off since early November. \n  The new restrictions, which come into effect on Saturday, run until 22 January. \n  \n Updated at 1.25pm GMT \n \n \n  1.11pm GMT  \n  \n  In-person Christmas shopping has begun in earnest for many Scots today as non-essential shops across the west of the country emerge from near lockdown restrictions today. \n  At her lunchtime briefing, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pleaded with the public to exercise caution. \u201cThe very, very last thing we want to see is overcrowding,\u201d she said, emphasising that those in the surrounding areas should not be travelling into Glasgow to do their festive shopping, given the ongoing ban on travel between level 3 local authorities. \n  The chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said Police Scotland\u2019s starting point over the festive period would be \u201cexplaining the rules and encouraging people to comply\u201d, but added that the force had issued 90 fixed-penalty notices for breach of travel restrictions since they came into force last month. \n  Sturgeon was also challenged on the recent decision by the Welsh government to move to online learning until Christmas, as well as the move from the Glasgow association of Scotland\u2019s largest teaching union, the EIS, to ballot teachers on strike action over classroom safety concerns. \n  Sturgeon said there was a \u201cmaterial difference\u201d in the prevalence of the virus in Wales, which is three times that in Scotland right now, but added that, as in England, there were plans to have further testing in schools.  \n  \n Updated at 1.24pm GMT \n \n \n  12.32pm GMT  \n  \n  Calls are growing for Germany to go into a tighter lockdown as the country\u2019s disease control centre reported record daily increases in coronavirus cases and deaths. \n  The Robert Koch Institute said the country\u2019s 16 states reported 29,875 new cases of Covid-19, breaking the previous daily record of 23,679 cases reported the day before. \n  The number of deaths from the virus rose by 598, to a total of 20,970. The previous daily record of deaths was 590, set on Wednesday. \n  \u201cThere clearly need to be extra measures, and I want to say as health minister that they are needed sooner rather than later,\u201d Jens Spahn said. \n  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive ourselves if this Christmas became above all a festival for the virus,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re honest, the virus doesn\u2019t take much account of whether we\u2019ve all finished our Christmas shopping or not.\u201d \n  Restrictions implemented at the beginning of November closed restaurants, bars, leisure and sports facilities but schools and non-essential shops have remained open. \n  The latest polls show nearly 50% of Germans back tougher restrictions, while 35% support the current lockdown measures. There have been protests against the regulations that have garnered much attention, but polls show less than 15% of Germans think they are too strict. \n  \n Updated at 12.43pm GMT \n \n \n  12.15pm GMT  \n  \n  My colleague Angela Giuffrida in Rome has just published this excellent exclusive report. It reveals how the World Health Organiztion has been accused of conspiring with the Italian health ministry to remove a report revealing the country\u2019s mismanagement of the first Covid wave. \n   \n    Related: WHO accused of conspiring with Italy to remove damning Covid report  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.43pm GMT \n \n \n  12.10pm GMT  \n Infections down in England \u2013 but not in London \n  \n  The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England has continued to decrease according to the weekly infection survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \n  An estimated 481,500 people within the community population in England had Covid-19 in the week of 29 November to 5 December 2020, equating to one in 115 people (95% credible interval: one in 120 to one in 105). \n  Though rates decreased in most English regions, the proportion of people testing positive in London has increased and there are early signs of increase in the east of England. \n  Other findings from the ONS include: \n   \n   In the most recent week, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in older teenagers and young adults, those aged 25 to 34 and 50 to 69; rates continue to be highest among secondary school age children. \n   The percentage of those testing positive has increased in recent weeks in Wales , with the ONS estimating 25,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 last week, equating to 1 in 120 people. \n   The percentage testing positive in Northern Ireland continues to decrease in the most recent week; the ONS estimates that 7,800 people in Northern Ireland had Covid-19, equating to 1 in 235 people. \n   The percentage testing positive in Scotland has remained relatively stable in recent weeks; during the most recent week (29 November to 5 December 2020), the ONS estimates that 43,300 people in Scotland had Covid-19, equating to 1 in 120 people. \n   \n  Katherine Kent, co-head of analysis for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: \n   \n   The evidence for England continues to show an overall decline in the level of infections, though we have recorded an increase in London and may have begun to see an increase in the East of England. Rates have declined in both older teenagers and young adults and remain highest amongst secondary school children. Across the UK, it\u2019s a mixed picture. Infections appear to be increasing in Wales whilst remaining stable in Scotland. Northern Ireland is continuing to see falling infection rates.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.46pm GMT \n \n \n  12.00pm GMT  \n Self-isolation in the UK cut from 14 to 10 days \n  \n  The self-isolation period for contacts of a positive coronavirus case will be cut from 14 days to 10, the UK\u2019s chief medical officers have announced. \n  Those required to quarantine after returning from countries which are not on the travel corridor list will also see their isolation period reduced, in an approach agreed by all four nations. \n  Health chiefs said in a joint statement that following a review of the evidence, they were \u201cconfident\u201d that the self-isolation period could be shortened. \n  This reduction already applies in Wales following an announcement by the Welsh Government earlier this week, while it will take effect in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland from Monday. \n  The new rules will apply to all those who are currently self-isolating, including those who began doing so before Monday. \n  \n Updated at 12.46pm GMT \n \n \n  11.23am GMT  \n  \n  Businesses across Northern Ireland reopened on Friday after a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown but infection and death rates remain high, fuelling fears of a swift resurgence of the virus. \n  Shops, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and gyms can reopen and normal church services resume. Pubs that do not serve food remain shut. \n  The region recorded 14 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday. There were 67 deaths in the past week, up seven on the previous week, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 1,099. \n  Officials also recorded 441 new cases on Thursday and said community transmission remained high, with the R value at around 1, meaning an infected person on average passes the disease to one other person. Hospitals are at 101% occupancy. \n  The region\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Ian Young, said compliance with the circuit-breaker had been disappointing. \n  Some ministers in the Stormont executive are nervous the disease will roar back. \u201cIf there is a festive free-for-all with public health advice ignored, then it will cost lives and place unbearable pressure on our hospitals,\u201d said Robin Swann, the health minister. \u201cWe must avoid these catastrophic consequences.\u201d \n  Arlene Foster, the first minister, defended the easing of restriction and said authorities would closely monitor the R number. \u201cWe have made provision that people can get together over Christmas but they should do so in a safe way, and just because we say you can doesn\u2019t mean that you have to, and that\u2019s very key.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 12.15pm GMT \n \n \n  10.13am GMT  \n  \n  The UK\u2019s AstraZeneca will investigate combining its experimental vaccine with Russia\u2019s Sputnik V candidate, it has said, in a move Russian scientists have suggested could sharply boost efficacy. \n  The developers of Sputnik V suggested on Twitter last month that AstraZeneca try the combination, saying: \n   \n   Sputnik V is happy to share one of its two human adenoviral vectors with AstraZeneca to increase the efficacy of (the) AstraZeneca vaccine. Using two different vectors for two vaccine shots will result in higher efficacy than using the same vector for two shots. \n   \n  On Friday, AstraZeneca said it was considering how it could assess combinations of different vaccines, and would soon begin exploring with Russia\u2019s Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V, whether two common cold virus-based vaccines could be successfully combined. \n  Data published in a journal this week showed that AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, being developed along with the University of Oxford, has average efficacy of 70.4%, based on a pooled analysis of interim data from late stage trials. \n  Russia has claimed Sputnik V is 92% effective at protecting people, according to interim trial results. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia\u2019s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which has funded Sputnik V, said: \n   \n   This shows the strength of Sputnik V technology and our willingness and desire to partner with other vaccines to fight against Covid together. \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.54am GMT  \n Indonesia reports worst daily death toll \n  \n  Indonesia has reported 6,310 infections and 175 deaths, the largest number of fatalities in a day, data from the country\u2019s taskforce show With Friday\u2019s data, Indonesia\u2019s total number of cases rose to 605,243, while the number of deaths rose to 18,511, both are the highest tallies in Southeast Asia. \n  \n \n \n  9.24am GMT  \n  \n  Russia, which began vaccinating vulnerable people in Moscow on Saturday, has resisted imposing a strict lockdown as it did in the spring, relying on targeted measures instead, though the Kremlin says places like St Petersburg are nearing a \u201cred line\u201d. \n  Some critics have called into question the official death toll, pointing to the significantly elevated number of excess deaths during the pandemic. \n  There were almost 50,000 more deaths in October compared with the same month last year and, with a total 205,456 deaths, October accounted for more deaths than any other month in 10 years, according to the state statistics service Rosstat. \n  Moscow rolled out its Sputnik V vaccine to doctors, teachers and social workers last weekend and a senior official said on Thursday that vaccinations would begin across the country by the end of the week. \n  \n \n \n  9.12am GMT  \n  \n  There are concerning signs of a possible resurgence of infections in the UK, where a member of the government\u2019s scientific advisory group, Sage, has warned people to respect social distancing measures. Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter told the BBC: \n   \n   The downward trend that happened after the higher tiers and lockdown has now stopped, cases are going up. \n   [There are] 350, 400 deaths a day in the UK \u2013 that\u2019s about 10,000 a month. And these are real deaths. These are extra deaths that would not have happened normally. \n   They are from Covid, they are not just with Covid. \n   I am sure people wanted a downward trend before Christmas to produce a, kind of, buffer before the Christmas season, because there is bound to be some effect. \n   Now, I wouldn\u2019t want to say what the size of that effect is going to be because it depends crucially on people\u2019s behaviour. And, how much they obey the rules and are sensible. \n   \n  Asked why there would be a Christmas impact on Covid, he said: \n   \n   Because there will be more travel. People will be mixing. And we can just see how behaviour just influences things. \n   This could be just a blip, and it might not be that big, I wouldn\u2019t want to say. I think we need to look beyond that towards the whole winter, I think. We can\u2019t make this disappear and we can\u2019t let it get out of control. And, it won\u2019t get out of control... that won\u2019t be allowed to happen. So, it\u2019s keeping a lid on it. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.56am GMT  \n Germany needs immediate hard lockdown, says interior minister \n  \n  Germany must go into a hard lockdown immediately to slow the spread, its interior minister Horst Seehofer has said, as the chancellor and the heads of the German states prepare to discuss further measures. He told Der Spiegel magazine: \n   \n   The only chance to regain control of the situation is a lockdown, but this must happen immediately. If we wait until Christmas, we\u2019ll have to struggle with high numbers for months. \n   \n  The nation reported its worst daily numbers of infections and deaths on Friday. \n  \n Updated at 11.33am GMT \n \n \n  8.53am GMT  \n Hundreds die as Russia suffers most costly day \n  \n  Russia reported 613 deaths in the last 24 hours on Friday; its worst daily toll so far. That takes its official cumulative death toll from the pandemic to 45,893. Authorities confirmed 28,585 new infections nationally, including 7,215 in Moscow, pushing the national case total to 2,597,711. \n  \n \n \n  8.51am GMT  \n  \n  The main priority of the UK government is to keep children in school, its culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: \n   \n   We are doing everything we can first of all to prioritise kids remaining in schools, and the vast majority of children remain in schools. And, secondly, to ensure that schools continue to be a safe place \u2013 and I pay tribute to teachers and head teachers and all the work they have done. \n   \n  When asked why England wasn\u2019t following Wales lead and closing schools, he said the government\u2019s testing plans had the objective of keeping pupils in education through mass testing. \n  \n \n \n  8.21am GMT  \n  \n  The German chancellor Angela Merkel and the premiers of the nation\u2019s 16 federal states will discuss new anti-pandemic measures on Sunday, the government of the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has said. \n  It added that a \u201chard lockdown\u201d until at least 10 January was necessary in the state to bring down the number of infections. \n  Germany reported its worst daily numbers of infections and deaths on Friday. The European Union\u2019s most populous nation went into a partial lockdown early last month, closing restaurants and bars and limiting the number of people allowed to meet. But schools and shops have remained open. \n  Merkel has urged German states, which are responsible for most disease-control measures, to introduce tougher measures before Christmas, but has met resistance. \n  However, most state governments agree on introducing tougher measures after Christmas. \n  \n \n \n  8.10am GMT  \n  \n  The French culture minister Roselyne Bachelot has requested an extra \u20ac35m (\u00a331m, $42m) to help cultural venues that will not reopen as planned on 15 December, as France seeks to stave off a third wave. She has told BFM Television: \n   \n   We already provided \u20ac7.5bn in aid to the sector. I told the prime minister that we would need an extra \u20ac35m to help the sector go through the end of the year. I know I will get that. \n   \n   France will not reopen museums, cinemas and theatres next week as planned because infection rates are not falling as fast as the government hoped, the prime minister Jean Castex said on Thursday. \n  \n \n \n  8.01am GMT  \n  \n  Hong Kong\u2019s government has secured millions of doses of vaccines for delivery as soon as January, the territory\u2019s leader Carrie Lam has announced. \n   \n   Assuming we adopt the two-dose regime, we need to procure 30m doses, and I\u2019m happy to report that ... we have made a breakthrough and reached an agreement with two manufacturers. \n   \n  Lam said Hong Kong has signed advance procurement orders with the mainland Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac, as well as Pfizer, to supply 7.5m vaccines each. The first batch of 1m doses will arrive early next year, she said. Officials are also on the cusp of securing a deal with AstraZeneca for 7.5m doses of its vaccine and are striving to secure a deal with a fourth supplier. \n   \n   Our next step is for the HKSAR government to be fully prepared to provide vaccination for the public. \n   \n  Based on WHO advice \u201cand common sense\u201d, elderly people \u2013 especially those in residential care homes \u2013 would be prioritised; alongside healthcare workers, chronic patients and care home staff. This accounts for about 3 million people. \n  Lam said advance orders mean those delivered may not have gone through all clinical trials or received approval yet. \n   \n   This is unlike normal procurement procedures. The policy objective is to provide free vaccines for the 7.5m people in Hong Kong. \n   \n  This was why they are procuring different options from at least two manufacturers, she said. \n   \n   \n    #BREAKING: #HK Chief Executive #CarrieLam says one million vaccines shots for #COVID19 produced by mainland pharmaceutical firm #Sinovac can arrive in Hong Kong as soon as Jan 2021; while the first batch of #Pfizervaccine HK buy may arrive in HK in the first quarter of 2021. pic.twitter.com/UoCxW8qb92\u2014 Candice (@candicewongky) December 11, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.38am GMT  \n  \n  Swissmedic has said it received additional details from companies on their vaccines that would enable it to issue authorisations quickly once sufficient data on safety, efficacy and quality were available. \n  However, it added: \u201cAn emergency approval for vaccines is not a legal option in Switzerland,\u201d the agency said, ruling out what it called \u201cpremature vaccinations\u201d for the Alpine country. \n  The world\u2019s eyes are on the UK as the first country to approve and roll out a vaccine \u2013 from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. \n  Switzerland said this month it has signed a contract to deliver 3m doses of the same vaccine.

The system has worked as it should. The expert advice has been given and the Government is acting in line with it.  \n   The clotting seen in few patients around the world is extremely rare, quite separate to normal thrombosis, and occurs at about 1 in 250,000. By comparison if you contract Covid-19 the risk of dying is much higher.  \n   This setback may slow down the vaccine rollout, but it also means the rollout is based on the best advice possible \u2013 it is not a race to the finish line.  \n   The AMA has always strongly insisted on decisions based on the best scientific advice made independently by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).  \n   The job of the TGA and ATAGI is to look at the risks versus benefits and to advise on who should have the AstraZeneca vaccine, and those who should not, based on the situation in Australia where fortunately we have little to no community transmission of Covid-19.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.36am BST \n \n \n  6.37am BST  \n  \n  A drunk and drugged driver who killed four children after mowing them down on a Sydney footpath has been jailed for at least 21 years. \n  Samuel William Davidson was driving erratically and speeding when he struck Veronique Sakr, 11, and her cousins, Sienna Abdallah, eight, and her siblings Angelina, 12, and Antony, 13. \n  The children had been walking to buy ice-creams when the 31-year-old ploughed into them after his ute mounted a kerb at Oatlands, in Sydney\u2019s north-west, on 1 February last year. \n  Judge James Bennett sentenced Davidson in Parramatta\u2019s district court on Friday, saying the menacing, dangerous and aggressive driving sustained over a significant period leading up to the tragic event showed all responsibility to the road safety of others was abandoned. \n  The tragedy was inevitable, but the magnitude of the tragedy extended to the unimaginable, Bennett said. \n  Read more: \n   \n    Related: Oatlands crash: drunk and drugged driver who killed four children sentenced to 21 years\u2019 jail  \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.25am BST  \n  \n  Another update regarding Western Australia\u2019s border arrangements with Queensland. \n  Subject to no further community cases, Queensland will transition to \u2018very low risk\u2019 from 12.01am on Monday, 19 April.

From the Royal Australasian College of Physicians release:  \n  RACP President, Professor John Wilson said Australians should follow the latest health advice. \n   \n    It is still far better to be protected from COVID-19 than not. The COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca can be used in adults aged under 50 years where the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks for that individual and the person has made an informed decision based on an understanding of the risks and benefits, as advised by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI),\u201d Prof. Wilson said. \n   \n  And if you have had your first dose of AstraZeneca, you can get your second:  \n   \n   It is important to note that those who were given their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine without serious side effects can be safely administered with their second dose, including those under 50 years of age. \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.31am BST  \n  \n  Health authorities in New South Wales have resumed administering the AstraZeneca vaccine after halting its rollout earlier on Friday due to blood clotting advice. \n  NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that AstraZeneca vaccines had been paused for recipients of all ages on Friday morning as health authorities waited for informed consent information to be updated.  \n  Speaking at the same time as Scott Morrison announced Australia\u2019s vaccine strategy would shift from AstraZeneca further behind the Pfizer vaccine, with a total of 40m doses, Berejiklian sought to reassure NSW residents over 50 they could still receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.  \n  While people over 50 have again been allowed to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday, the temporary pause will continue until Monday for eligible recipients under 50. \n  From Monday, those under 50 will again be able to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in NSW, by which point an updated consent form will be ready.  \n  Berejiklian justified Friday\u2019s \u201cslight pause\u201d as being necessary to brief clinicians and health care workers who might not have had time to understand the new information revealed at the prime minister\u2019s press conference on Thursday night.  \n  Berejiklian said:  \n   \n   It was very difficult to make sure that everybody had that information and we\u2019ll always do what\u2019s in the best interest of our citizens. We didn\u2019t want people turning up and not being aware of what was going on or not.  \n   It\u2019s really important for people to assess their own health risks but if you\u2019re over 50 you should not be overly concerned with getting AstraZeneca vaccine in fact, the chances of you acquiring or getting an adverse reaction are very low.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.30am BST  \n NSW resumes AstraZeneca vaccinations \n  \n  We told you it would be brief \u2013 Gladys Berejiklian has announced NSW has resumed AstraZeneca vaccinations \u2013 it just needed to change some admin to take into account the new advisory.  \n  \n Updated at 5.35am BST \n \n \n  5.29am BST  \n  \n  So, what do we take from all of that? \n  The hour long press conference (just short of 10,000 words uttered in that time, for those wondering) didn\u2019t tell us a lot. \n  First thing \u2013 the government and the expert health advisors want you to know that AstraZeneca is safe for over 50s and if you are in that cohort, you should speak to your doctor about getting the vaccine. \n  There is no blanket ban on the AstraZeneca vaccine for people under-50 \u2013 talk to your doctor about whether or not it is an option for you. \n  Another 20m Pfizer doses have been added to Australia\u2019s supply contract \u2013 bringing the total to 40m (and making Michael McCormack accidentally right when he said Australia had secured 40m doses that one time) but the additional doses aren\u2019t scheduled to arrive until quarter 4 \u2013 about six months away. \n  There is no vaccination timetable beyond phases 1A and 1B at the moment.  \n  \n Updated at 5.37am BST \n \n \n  5.22am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison is doing the fidgeting thing he does as he gets ready to leave a press conference at the end of an answer, so I know this is the last question. \n  He is asked whether vaccinated Australians will be able to come home easier. \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I\u2019m pleased to know that since the September meeting last year, more than 120,000 Australians have come home...we\u2019re seeing a reduction in the number of people registered to come back.  \n   And so that\u2019s welcome. And that\u2019s actually been achieved at a time when we\u2019ve had constraints on arrivals coming in.  \n   I\u2019m pleased that Victoria is opening up to flights again.  \n   That\u2019s really going to assist the task. I\u2019m looking forward to Queensland going back to their capacity. I\u2019m forever thankful to New South Wales for, despite having the challenges they\u2019ve had from time to time, they have kept those flights coming in. If it wasn\u2019t for the New South Wales government, it would be, you know, tens of thousands of Australians who would not be home now.  \n   And we thank them for the great work they have done to support the Commonwealth in achieving those outcomes. As others states have. I look forward to that occurring.  \n   I look forward to the time, as more and more Australians are vaccinated and there\u2019s growing... that we\u2019re able to take these additional steps that national cabinet wants to take.  \n   We really want Australians to know that: A - we\u2019re living in a country at the moment in a way very few others around the world are living. We\u2019re in a position that others envy. If you move around the country, from the west coast to the east coast, people are going out, they\u2019re enjoying getting together as families, they\u2019re going to sporting and cultural events, they are returning at least domestically to a life they knew before the pandemic.  \n   The international borders aren\u2019t open yet. Those sort of things are not occurring yet. But if we keep going down this path, we\u2019ll continue to lead the world in our response to the pandemic and the economic comeback which is growing each and every day. \n   \n  Annnnd he\u2019s out \n  \n Updated at 5.27am BST \n \n \n  5.17am BST  \n  \n  Professor Paul Kelly takes that same question: \n   \n   I only will just say all of the advice has been given across all countries in Europe and the UK and here in relation to AstraZeneca is based on the same data.  \n   And it\u2019s the context specificity that is important. What it means for our aid to PNG, in a different context, they only have AstraZeneca available, they don\u2019t have a choice, and their risk from COVID, a large COVID-19 outbreak of severe infection, hospitals being overwhelmed, and death, is a real thing. For us it\u2019s a different thing. And the medical advice is based on that current context. \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.17am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison is asked whether the government has considered rejecting the AstraZeneca advice as \u2018bad advice\u2019? \n  Q: You\u2019ve made a virtue of accepting the medical advice - why shouldn\u2019t some of us see that advice has been bad advice, terribly risk adverse advice, our regulators are taking a more risk adverse attitude than in the UK.  \n  And they\u2019re measuring the risk against zero. But aren\u2019t there any factors they should have taken into account. Why can\u2019t you reject advice, if you all think it\u2019s safe for most of the population, why can\u2019t we just do that? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   That\u2019s what the advice says.  \n   The advice does not put a ban on its administration of the doses across the population. It doesn\u2019t do that. It - it informs as to a very remote risk.  \n   And I would think Australians would want to know that.  \n   And it advises a preference where there\u2019s a choice of vaccines. And that\u2019s what it does.  \n   I wouldn\u2019t agree and Professor Murphy or Professor Kelly may wish to speak to this as well, that the advice we receive is inconsistent with what is happening in other places.  \n   That\u2019s not the case across Europe. In some cases it\u2019s even more than where it is in Australia.  \n   Our position on 50 as recommended to us is very consistent with the medical advice across Europe. And if - if all of those European countries had gone down that path, and Australia had taken a different position, at a lower age group, and our understanding from ATAGI, they\u2019re the experts, is that the medical advice supports the age advice of 50.  \n   And that means over 50, they\u2019re very, very strong of the view that those over that - over that age - are not faced with that same remote risk as is there is for a younger population.  \n   Not having the vaccine, particularly for elder Australians, is a greater risk to their health. That\u2019s why I encourage them to take the vaccine.  \n   When it comes to medical advice, I think we\u2019ve been served very well. You don\u2019t get to choose the medical advice that\u2019s provided by the medical experts*.  \n   And as a prime minister, or a Premier, we consider that advice and we make decisions.  \n   We haven\u2019t gone beyond the advice, we haven\u2019t gone below the advice. It\u2019s important we consider other factors in terms of the impact on the economy and things of that nature and we regularly do.  \n   But in relation to this advice, it is sufficiently precautionary. But end of the day, it leaves it in your hands to ensure they can take the advice from their own doctor and ensure they\u2019re vaccinated.  \n   The more Australians that get vaccinated, the more that happens, the more options the Premiers and I have. That\u2019s what Australians want.  \n   And that\u2019s why I want to continue to encourage Australians to speak to their doctors and to participate in the vaccination program. We\u2019re dealing with populations that are not directly impacted by this advice. There\u2019s front-line health workers that are, but I\u2019m confident we can deal with their needs through the supplies we have, more or less in the time frame we hope to do that by. When we move to the next phase, we\u2019ll be addressing that in the weeks ahead. \n   \n  *Pretty sure the premiers who were heavily criticised in the past for closing borders also didn\u2019t choose the health advice they followed, but at least we are all on the same page now. Amazing how that happens.  \n  \n \n \n  5.11am BST  \n Government cannot outline new vaccine timetable. \n  \n  Not in 1A or 1B (like most of us) \u2013 the government can\u2019t tell you when you will receive your vaccine. \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   We\u2019re not in a position at the moment to reconfirm a timetable. We\u2019re not in that position.  \n   And I\u2019m not going to do that. Regardless of the invitation.  \n   We\u2019re going to work through the implications of this most recent medical advice, for the calibration of the rollout.  \n   And the fact that we\u2019ve now been able to secure an additional 20,000 Pfizer vaccines for quarter 4 is very encouraging.  \n   \n  And on the suspension of the NSW vaccination program (expected to be brief), Morrison says: \n   \n   I spoke to the New South Wales premier about this today.  \n   It\u2019s an administrative issue, not a medical issue. They are updating their systems to have the new consent arrangements put in place. So to categorise as some sort of medical ban on New South Wales would be false. It would be incorrect. It would be misleading. And ... I don\u2019t think that would be a good way to describe it in those terms. \n   I have spoken to the premier. They put this in place simply to update their forms. It\u2019s an administrative process.  \n   It\u2019s not about the vaccine.  \n   I\u2019ve had that directly from the premier. So, I would caution people not to be concerned by that process. It\u2019s simply a matter of updating the systems, to reflect what has occurred overnight, to ensure the appropriate consent forms are in place, and that we can ensure that that consent provision is being respected by the governments, at a state and federal level, and individuals can have that appropriate consent. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.12am BST \n \n \n  5.08am BST  \n  \n  Does the Pfizer vaccine change anything for GPs and (eventually) pharmacies (unlike AstraZeneca, the Pfizer vaccine requires special needles and special refrigeration requirements \u2013 it has to be kept at -70 degrees.) \n  Brendan Murphy: \n   \n   The GP program continues. There are most of the people \u2013 the GPs are vaccinating over 50s, over 70s and 80s. They need the vaccine, we\u2019re providing the vaccine, they\u2019re turning up to get vaccinated.  \n   The GP program right through 1A and 1B will continue as it is. As we get to 2A, there\u2019s people over 50 and over 60 who will also be able to go to their GPs to get vaccinated.  \n   It\u2019s true we planned in phase two to roll out pharmacies. We\u2019re looking at how we\u2019ll do that now.  \n   We need to recalibrate to see how we may get more Pfizer and how we deal with the under 50 as we get to phase 2B. \n   The Pfizer vaccine \u2013 there\u2019s TGA registration changes that have would allow the Pfizer vaccine to be transported and stored at refrigeration temperature without \u2013 for a longer period of time.  \n   That would make it easier from a logistical capacity, if we were to use Pfizer in mass vaccination clinics or pharmacies.  \n   We\u2019re considering all the options. Given that people are pulling out of appointments, the New South Wales state government announcing they were pausing AstraZeneca for all age groups today.  \n   Are you concerned you are losing control over the vaccine rollout to those voices and giving voices to the anti-vax crowd, and can you stand here today with any certainty and that all adult Australians would have at least one jab by Christmas? \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.13am BST \n \n \n  5.05am BST  \n  \n  Asked how he can maintain public confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine (the prime minister received the Pfizer vaccine for those interested, as part of the first rollout) Scott Morrison says: \n   \n   By doing this, by being very clear in the communication what the medical advice is. The media has a role in play in that as well.  \n   The information is very clear that if you\u2019re over the age of 50, it is recommended that you do have the vaccine. Covid-19, if there were to be another wave in Australia, the people most vulnerable to death from Covid-19 are those who are are in 1B.  \n   You would be putting yourself at risk, you would be putting yourself at risk if you didn\u2019t get the vaccine, because you would be exposing yourself to the more likely event of a Covid contracted condition that could result in serious illness.  \n   So Covid is a much greater threat by a factor many, many times over than the AstraZeneca vaccine.  \n   The AstraZeneca vaccine is a life-saving vaccine and particularly for vulnerable Australians.  \n   That\u2019s why I want my mum to get it, and that\u2019s why I want your mum to get it, and your your dad, your uncle, your aunt, your brother, your sister. That\u2019s a life-saving vaccine. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.10am BST \n \n \n  5.03am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison says he wants to get Australia to the point where it treats Covid like the flu: \n   \n   If we are in a position to have vaccinated 1A and 1B then that has implications for being in a position where we can begin starting to treat Covid-19 like the flu. That\u2019s where national cabinet wants to be.  \n   We want to get Australia to a position where we can treat Covid-19 in the same way as we treat many other viruses.  \n   It doesn\u2019t mean the virus can\u2019t be present, it just means that the virus is not going to lead to the disastrous outcomes we have are seeing overseas.  \n   The flu, every year, sadly has impacts on Australians including fatalities sadly, but that being the case we haven\u2019t engaged in mass lockdowns of our country because of the flu.  \n   But we are not at that point yet and I think we soon will be so we\u2019ll continue to roll out the vaccines from CSL.  \n   We will continue to secure the other vaccines that we have from the other sources and where we have vaccines that we can make available, particularly in our own region as part of the Quad initiative and in the Indo-Pacific and especially for our Pacific family we will certainly be doing that. In fact, I have already diverted a number of those vaccines to assist the effort in both Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.10am BST \n \n \n  5.01am BST  \n  \n  So given the previous delays have been blamed on supply issues, how do we suddenly have 20m more doses and can the public trust it? Also, where are the new doses coming from? \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   The additional vaccines we have been able to secure for the fourth quarter of this year are not vaccines that obviously would have been available here and now.  \n   Here and now we have the availability of vaccines of Pfizer from our original contract which is for 20 million as well as the contracts with AstraZeneca and so supply is the fundamental factor.  \n   The supply of that vaccine and how it\u2019s been used in our vaccination roll out obviously is impacted by the events of the past 24 hours, events that were not foreseen. These issues did not come up with the trials as was said last night.  \n   They are quite rare circumstances where these side effects become apparent. I stress again, that there is no ban or prohibition on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine across the adult population.  \n   There is a recommendation for a preference but these are matters that individuals can discuss with their doctor.  \n   Even when we get to the next phase, in phase 2, we are still talking about millions and millions of Australians over the age of 50 for whom the AstraZeneca vaccine is recommended. Not recommended against, recommended for, that AstraZeneca is a vaccine that can be very effectively used and is very effective in supporting Australia\u2019s vaccination program. So all up now we had 170 million doses contracted, prior to today we had 150 million doses contracted but when there are events that require us to be fleet footed, to shore up our supplies then we have taken those decisions but in terms of the roll out and the timing I will leave that to the minister. \n   \n  Greg Hunt: \n   \n   Very briefly, I think the key phrase is the timing of supply. So it is the timing of the initial supplies right around the world.  \n   Those countries that were producing their own, in particular the United Kingdom and the United States, had access to very large volumes.  \n   Obviously I think everybody will be aware of the challenges that Europe has faced.  \n   We have been in the fortunate position just as Prof Murphy has shown with the ramp-up because we have had AstraZeneca with home-grown production through CSL allowing us to ramp-up that supply earlier. I think there have been some figures put about but I see it as about 5.5% of the adult population which has out in been reached and has multi-plied by more than fourfold in just over 2.5 weeks.  \n   In terms of the origin, it is for the individual companies to identify if they wish to identify the source, the commercial arrangements are such - and the security arrangements are such \u2013 that we have been asked not to identify the particular sources.  \n   I apologise for that but that is understandable. In terms of the investment, our total investment in vaccines alone is over $4bn and our total investment the vaccine program is now over $7bn. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.11am BST \n \n \n  4.57am BST  \n  \n  Why didn\u2019t the government make deals with Moderna (Dolly Parton\u2019s vaccine) and Johnson &amp; Johnson to head off these sorts of problems? \n  Scott Morrison points back to the expert health advisers: \n   \n   We took the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group as we have done all through this process. Our entire approach has been to follow the advice of the medical [personnel] who have assessed these matters in great detail and provided their recommendations to government. That group is led by Prof Murphy so I think he is best placed to answer your question. \n   \n  Prof Brendan Murphy then gets the floor: \n   \n   So the Scientific Advisory Group strongly recommended that we have a stake in the mRNA vaccine and we went with Pfizer mainly because of its capacity to deliver and it was not a new company and experience has shown they have delivered a whole lot more vaccine than Moderna.  \n   Had we had a contract with Moderna we would have had not very much delivered at this time.  \n   We are focusing on increasing Pfizer, the two vaccines are similar. Johnson &amp; Johnson we have been in discussions with. We have had the AstraZeneca vaccine which is an adenovirus vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson is one too.  \n   We still don\u2019t know what the cause of this adverse effect is, whether it relates to just this vaccine or other adenoviruses, we have to wait and see so at the moment we are still exploring with Johnson &amp; Johnson as we have with every other company but every single recommendation of the scientific and technical advisory group that has been made to government has been accepted. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.59am BST \n \n \n  4.54am BST  \n  \n  Will the original 20m Pfizer doses be brought forward and how many of the extra doses will be arriving each week when those quarters (about six months away) roll up? \n  Greg Hunt: \n   \n   What\u2019s Pfizer\u2019s indicated we will see an expansion in April. They have asked that we provide the numbers when we have confirmation and so at this stage they are indicating an expansion in April as opposed to the figures we have been approximately 130,000-plus a week.  \n   Again an expansion in May, quite a significant expansion in May. Then in June there\u2019s likely to be a near doubling - sorry July, there\u2019s likely to be a near doubling which will track through to the rest of the year.  \n   I apologise at the request of the company because they haven\u2019t confirmed the exact figures that they ask that we speak in indicative terms. Then the 20 million that has just been purchased at this point in time is settled for the fourth quarter but we are working with them on the possibility of bringing forward as many of those doses as possible. There\u2019s no false promises on that. \n   \n  Again, so far, we have received about 1m of the 20m Pfizer doses.  \n  \n \n \n  4.52am BST  \n  \n  Proessor Paul Kelly is repeating the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe for over 50 year olds. \n  There is a double job for the government now \u2013 maintain confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine, the only one we have a licence to make in Australia, as well as work out what the new rollout will look like. \n  \n Updated at 4.57am BST \n \n \n  4.49am BST  \n  \n  Prof Brendan Murphy is going through what the data releases will look like \u2013 you\u2019ll see how many people have been vaccinated, where the doses are going, and how the rollout is progressing. \n  Scott Morrison interrupts the slide show to point out the federal government\u2019s role: \n   \n   I just want to note that is the number of commonwealth-administered doses that are occurring in the state, they are not doses being done by the states, they are doses being done within those states by the commonwealth program. \n   \n  Murphy then repeats the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe for over 50 year olds. Morrison says his mum, who is sitting in The Lodge right now, he says, will be getting the AZ vaccine and was happy for him to share that news.  \n  \n Updated at 4.57am BST \n \n \n  4.46am BST  \n  \n  The short version of that Scott Morrison comment \u2013 the states aren\u2019t giving up their powers on when they can close the borders, and no one knows yet when the international borders can be open, or when Australians can travel without having to quarantine on their way back (because we don\u2019t know when they will be vaccinated). \n  \n Updated at 4.47am BST \n \n \n  4.45am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison on the borders: \n   \n   What we are asking the medical expert panel to tell us is what are the thresholds that we need to be able to meet to do things such as the following \u2013 Australians who are vaccinated being able to travel overseas and return to Australia and not go into hotel quarantine, potentially go into hotel quarantine or not even into home quarantine at all.  \n   That will be a major change and to extent to which Australians returning from overseas who have had recognised vaccines also approved here in Australia with appropriate accreditation can return to Australia on that same basis and to enable potentially down the track travel from low-risk countries with similar vaccine arrangements.  \n   No one is saying that any of those things are coming in today but what we are working and planning for and have tasked the medical professionals who advise us on is what are the marks we have to meet to enable us to start opening up Australia more than we are now?  \n   We already have the New Zealand open arrangement. We welcome that and we look forward to the success of that in the coming months.  \n   That will give us a greater deal of confidence about when we can move to other countries. I have mentioned Singapore before as an obvious next choice but at this stage it is still some time away.  \n   The message from national cabinet is we want to open up more, we want to do it safely, we want to ease restrictions, we want to do that in a consistent way across the country and we want to do that because we know we are not just managing the health but we are managing the economics as well for people\u2019s livelihoods and wellbeing and this is going to be an ongoing and increasing focus of the national cabinet.  \n   We noted the work that is being done in New Zealand and we also note that of course at the end of the day every state and territory is responsible for public health in their own jurisdiction so they haven\u2019t offered up their sovereignty on those issues, that wasn\u2019t likely, but I do very much welcome their agreement to those principles today. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.48am BST \n \n \n  4.43am BST  \n  \n  Qantas had been pushing to open the international borders by October 2021. \n  Last year, in the budget, Treasury assumed borders would be open in the second half of this year. \n  At the moment though, with no guarantees under 50s will be vaccinated by the end of the year, that is all in doubt.  \n  \n \n \n  4.41am BST  \n  \n  Now, according to the ABS, there are about 12 million 16 to 49-year-olds in Australia (Pfizer is recommended for 16-year-olds and over.) \n  So that is quite a bit of the population, who don\u2019t have a set timeline yet for when they can receive the recommended (at this stage) vaccine. \n  \n Updated at 4.49am BST \n \n \n  4.40am BST  \n  \n  Greg Hunt on the timing (a lot of words here, which don\u2019t say a lot): \n   \n   In terms of the continuity of the program I think it is very important to emphasise that the basic settings as we progress through 1A and 1B and even phase 2A are largely unchanged.  \n   In 1A we will have the aged care residents. We will have the front-line workers and the quarantine workers, those programs in the case of the quarantine and the frontline health workers are largely completed and we thank the states for that.  \n   The aged care, as you can hear, is progressing very significantly with now over 133,000 people vaccinated and then we would have to make a change with regards to ensuring those who are under 50 that still haven\u2019t been vaccinated have access to Pfizer.  \n   With regards to phase 1B, this is the over 70s and the over 80s and the over 55 Indigenous Australians.  \n   All of those can continue to receive with the strongest medical advice the AstraZeneca.  \n   That, I think, is important and we are seeing that in those numbers coming through.  \n   For those who may be immuno compromised or frontline workers who are under 50, then right now we are working with the states and territories and the medical authorities to revise that part of the program so as they have access to Pfizer.  \n   That will take time. We recognise that as those Pfizer doses become available but we are working on that front.  \n   Then as we move into phase 2A, that itself is also focused on the over 50s and over 60s and their access to AstraZeneca remains unchanged.  \n   It is really after that with regards to the under 50s and that is the same time as we start to have very significant doses of Pfizer come onboard. So that\u2019s how we are managing the program. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.49am BST \n \n \n  4.38am BST  \n  \n  Greg Hunt is trying to find all of the silver linings in this mess. \n  But key here \u2013 the extra doses Australia has secured were already part of our contract. That was one of the failsafes put in \u2013 we had an option to extend the contract beyond the 20m Pfizer doses (enough for 10m people) already, which is why saying we now need more hasn\u2019t been a giant deal. Still, there has so far only been about a million of those doses delivered. The numbers are all well and good but the important bit here is the timing. And that\u2019s still largely unknown. \n  Hunt: \n   \n   As the PM set out we have been able to secure an additional 20 million doses of Pfizer by exercising the capacity within our contract and with rapid negotiations with Pfizer Australia and Pfizer Global.  \n   I do want to thank the head of Pfizer Australia, Anne Harris, and all of those within the department for being able to complete this process for purchasing within such a short period of time.  \n   We already had 20 million Pfizer doses which had been committed for delivery in 2021 and this brings an additional 20 million doses on top of the Novavax 51 million, the AstraZeneca 53.8 million and the COVAX facility 25.5 million taking it to a total available pool of 170 million doses. \n   \n  Again \u2013 those numbers might look great, but it\u2019s the *timing* of the deliveries and then the rollout which is going to be important to most people.  \n  \n Updated at 4.50am BST \n \n \n  4.33am BST  \n  \n  National cabinet also discussed the government\u2019s response to the Respect@Work report \u2013 and the states and territories will have to account for their spending on domestic violence programs. \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   I was also pleased today to discuss with the states and territories the next phase of the Covid family and domestic violence package.  \n   We are working through that information as you will be aware, it was 130 of the 150 million that the commonwealth put in police as an urgent Covid response last year. That terminating program, that emergency support runs to 30 June.  \n   As I indicated, I think it was yesterday, that we are looking at the next phase of that program but in order to do that I have asked from the states to give us an urgent update on their spending, their acquittal, if you like, of the funds that have already been provided to the states and territories this year, highlighting what their ongoing spending programs are in this area so we can ensure that any commonwealth program is adding \u2013 adding \u2013 to the overall effort here and of course wouldn\u2019t be replacing any effort.  \n   This remains an urgent issue because Covid is still happening and the impacts, particularly for vulnerable Australian, particularly women and children, as a result of many of the impacts of Covid are ongoing. So we are looking at that favourably but I intend to do that in partnership with the states and territories, equally sharing the challenge both fiscally and in the delivery of programs. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.36am BST \n \n \n  4.31am BST  \n  \n  We are now going to get more data and transparency around the vaccine program rollout. \n  This is important \u2013 the government is now racing to contain any vaccine hesitancy and attempt to maintain faith in the public health response. For that to happen, there needs to be sunlight. \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   We also agreed today, very productively, and Prof Murphy will take you through the first iteration of this, on data release and transparency measures that will see both daily release of information and Prof Murphy will take you through very shortly what those daily info graphics, that daily information will be that will be available to the public and of course to the media as well as weekly information that shows more detailed data at a state, territory and commonwealth level across both the available doses and the administration of those doses. I am sure you will all find that very helpful in your own reporting and to the public. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.51am BST \n \n \n  4.29am BST  \n Vaccine roll out to be 'recalibrated' \n  \n  Scott Morrison on what the national cabinet discussed: \n   \n   We discussed the recalibration of our vaccination program because of the advice from ATAGI today and that was a constructive discussion and already today states and territories are working with the commonwealth to that end. Our focus remains on the delivery of 1A and 1B cohorts for the vaccination rollout.  \n   This is particularly important because we\u2019re substantively talking here about people who are over the age of 50 and as Prof Murphy reminded us today that includes many health worker, many health workers that are in frontline roles whether working in aged care facilities or otherwise within the health system and particularly amongst the nursing community.  \n   That is not to say there are not those under 50, of course there are, but we are talking about groups where we can continue to proceed with the vaccination roll out at the pace we are hoping to proceed at and to ensure that we meet the goals we have with those 1 A and 1B cohorts.  \n   This is important because the goal here is to protect the most vulnerable in our community.  \n   If we want to treat Covid-19 like the flu then we need to ensure that we\u2019re vaccinating those in our community who are most vulnerable.  \n   The most vulnerable people in our community are not just over 50, they are actually a lot older than that.  \n   The AstraZeneca vaccine is well suited to address those critical vulnerable groups.  \n   We reminded ourselves this morning that the key issue that we were concerned about a year ago as we feared the overwhelming of our public hospitals and all of these rather dire outcomes was because of the vulnerability of our most elderly Australians.  \n   So vaccinating our elderly Australians remains a key priority that also supports the continued opening up of Australia because the risk factor of severe illness amongst the most vulnerable is therefore reduced. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.51am BST \n \n \n  4.26am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison moves to the AstraZeneca advisory: \n   \n   The decision of the commonwealth government, because it is a matter for the commonwealth government to accept the advice of ATAGI on these matters, was understood and supported and I want to stress again that the advice that has been received, the recommendations that have been received from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is not a ban on the AstraZeneca vaccine, it is not a prohibition on the AstraZeneca vaccine, it recommends and notes that the risk of these side effects are remote. They are very rare.  \n   We are talking in the vicinity of five to six per million, which is a rather rare event. But it must be acknowledged.  \n   It\u2019s important so Australians can make informed decisions about their vaccination and their healthcare with their medical professionals, with their doctor. So there was no instruction not to take that vaccine.  \n   There is an acknowledgement of the risk that is there but as is the case always with these matters these are decisions for Australians. Certainly for those who are over 50 there is a strong encouragement to be taking this AstraZeneca vaccine which we discussed today to ensure that we can continue down the path of the vaccination rollout. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.32am BST \n \n \n  4.25am BST  \n  \n  That\u2019s around the same time Australia is also supposed to receive the Novavax vaccine \u2013 that is still under clinical trials in the US. It\u2019s a goal we will have it by quarter 3, not a guarantee.  \n  \n Updated at 4.32am BST \n \n \n  4.22am BST  \n Scott Morrison press conference \n  \n  Scott Morrison says the government has secured \u201canother 20 million\u201d doses of the Pfizer vaccine \u2013 bringing the Pfizer total to 40m \u2013 enough for 20m people (you get two shots of this one). \n  They won\u2019t be available until quarter four though \u2013 that\u2019s the end of the year. \n  \n Updated at 4.23am BST \n \n \n  4.21am BST  \n  \n  The first slide is headed \u201cCovid-19 vaccine roll-out, 9 April 2021\u201d. \n  The only thing we know for sure is there are going to be delays.

But this means there can be variations in dates on a global, regional or local level. \n  Grand Mufti Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohamad said in a statement the council are continuing their recent pattern of announcing Islamic calendar dates well in advance to avoid surprise or confusion in the community.  \n   \n   The sun will set on Monday the 12th of April at 5.36pm (Sydney local time) and the moon will appear on the same day after sunset for 17 minutes until 5.53pm where it will disappear thereafter from the horizon.  \n   In the city of Perth, Western Australia, the sun will set on Monday at 5.59pm (Perth local time) and the moon will appear on the same day after sunset for 19 minutes until 6.18pm where it will disappear thereafter from the horizon.  \n   This allows for ample time to sight the moon under normal conditions with the absence of all that hinders the moon from being sighted. \n   \n  This also means it\u2019s likely the important end of Ramadan celebration, Eid-ul-Fitr, will be most probably celebrated on Thursday 13 May. \n  \n Updated at 2.01am BST \n \n \n  1.11am BST  \n  \n  Offical morning coffee game ruling: ADOPTED \n   \n   \n    @matildaboseley can we sip for \u201can abundance of caution\u201d?#guardiancoffeedrinkinggame\u2014 Pip R (@friggin_pippin) April 9, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.09am BST  \n  \n  The AstraZeneca advisory warning could be reconsidered if Australia experiences a large outbreak, says the co-chair of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, Prof Allen Cheng.  \n  In a lengthy (and very helpful) Twitter threat last night explaining the ATAGI decision, Cheng said if cases of Covid-19 rose in Australia the risk-benefit balance would change, suggesting the AZ could once again be recommended for people under 50.  \n   \n   \n    If we had a large outbreak, then this risk benefit analysis would change and we'd have to reconsider this advice.

That\u2019s our job, to be constructive.  \n   We have done our job, Scott Morrison has not done his job and he had just one job, to get this vaccine rollout right. And it is that failure that\u2019s undermining going forward, because anyone who looked at last night\u2019s media conference would have seen a prime minister, a health minister, being confused, being uncertain. \n   It\u2019s Scott Morrison that said that he would underpromise and overdeliver when he said there would be four million Australians vaccinated by the end of March. The fact that hasn\u2019t happened undermines confidence and the undermining of that sits squarely with Scott Morrison. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.39am BST \n \n \n  12.32am BST  \n  \n  Albanese:  \n   \n   Now, Labor will always accept the advice of the TGA and ATAGI. And we accept the advice they have given to the government overnight.  \n   But we also say they should have listened to the expert advice that was given to the government and indeed to all governments about not placing all our eggs in one basket. About making sure that we hedged our bets, if you like, because we knew, just like the UQ vaccine fell over, we knew that there can be issues with the rollout of a vaccine such as this.  \n   Which is why international best practice would have had us do deals over Moderna, over Johnson &amp; Johnson. In the UK, with the changes made to AstraZeneca, they can just be replaced. And more use of Moderna, for example, in the UK, can fill that void. Here in Australia, we\u2019re not in that position which is why there is such uncertainty.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.40am BST \n \n \n  12.29am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese going for a deep cut here with a scandal from February:  \n   \n   Scott Morrison likes using the Liberal party logo on announcements related to the vaccine.  \n   Well, Australians won\u2019t forget who is responsible for failing to deliver on what are his own promises and his own commitments when it comes to these issues. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.40am BST \n \n \n  12.28am BST  \n  \n  We are used to starting Covid-19 press conferences by comparing Australia to other countries across the world. It\u2019s just usually a more favourable comparison than this.  \n  Albanese:  \n   \n   Scott Morrison said that we were at the front of the queue. Nothing could be further from the truth.  \n   Australia\u2019s struggling to get into the top 100 when it comes to the rollout of the vaccine. Where in areas like the United Kingdom we have 60% of the adult population have been vaccinated. Israel\u2019s right at the top with 100% of their population being vaccinated.  \n   And we\u2019re struggling to get beyond 2 or 3% at this point in time.  \n   Scott Morrison said and repeated on January 7 the clear commitment that 4 million people could be vaccinated by the end of March. We know that figure is less than 1 million to even receive their first jab.  \n   Scott Morrison has tried to redefine when people are vaccinated from having two jabs by the end of October, into having just one. Trying to change the goalposts and yesterday he couldn\u2019t even say if people would be vaccinated by the end of 2021.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.40am BST \n \n \n  12.24am BST  \n  \n  Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has called the rollout of the vaccine a \u201cdebacle\u201d, blaming the government for not purchasing a wider range of vaccines.  \n   \n   Have got this wrong. The rollout of the vaccine is a debacle.  \n   We now have circumstances whereby just under 20% of aged care residents have been vaccinated. They have stopped promising to roll out the vaccine to aged care staff and are now telling aged care staff to check with their GP.  \n   Labor was warning for a long period of time that we needed to do what international best practice told us we should do, to have access to five or six vaccines. The fact that we now have such uncertainty about the rollout is a direct result of an arrogant government that was too focused on the 24-hour media cycle and not focused on what Australia needed. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.26am BST \n \n \n  12.19am BST  \n  \n  AstraZeneca issued a statement last night in response to the Australian government\u2019s decision to recommend against the vaccine for people under 50, saying, \u201cWe respect the decision taken by the Australian government based on advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)\u201d. \n  ATAGI is an independent advisory group made up of medical experts and it advises the health minister, Greg Hunt.  \n  \u201cRegulators around the world, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), have reviewed the rare clotting events and did not identify any risk factors, such as age or gender, or a definite cause for these extremely rare events,\u201d the AstraZeneca statement said. \n   \n   However, they came to the view that these events have a possible link to the vaccine and requested they be listed as an extremely rare potential side effect. \n   In addition, the World Health Organisation noted today that, whilst concerning, the events under assessment are very rare, with low numbers reported among the almost 200 million individuals who have received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine around the world. \n   \n  Overall, regulatory agencies have reaffirmed the vaccine offers a high-level of protection against all severities of Covid-19 and that these benefits continue to far outweigh the risks. \n   \n   We note that the current situation in Australia with very low to no community transmission of Covid-19 was a factor in this updated recommendation from ATAGI and their view that the risk-versus-benefit assessment for the use of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine may be different for Australia compared to other countries, such as those with widespread transmission.  \n   Patient safety remains AstraZeneca\u2019s highest priority and we continue to support regulators in Australia and overseas.

In 2019, that figure had increased to 424. \n   Today, it stands at 474. \n   At least five of those deaths have happened since the beginning of March this year. \n   \n  You can read the full report below: \n   \n    Related: The 474 deaths inside: tragic toll of Indigenous deaths in custody revealed  \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.54pm BST \n \n \n  11.45pm BST  \n  \n  A man is on the run after allegedly stabbing a 16-year-old boy to death in Brisbane\u2019s CBD, reports AAP.  \n  Police say the man allegedly stabbed the teenager in the stomach at Emma Miller Place near Roma Street train station at about 8pm on Thursday. \n  It is alleged the boy was known to the man.  \n  The boy then walked to nearby King George Square where he keeled over and collapsed in front of Brisbane City Hall. \n  Queensland Police and paramedics were called and the 16-year-old was then rushed to the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital where he died. \n  The man is still on the run on Friday morning. \n  He\u2019s believed to have headed towards Roma Street Parklands after the attack, but detectives are reviewing CCTV footage to confirm that. \n  They have called for any witnesses to come forward. \n  \n Updated at 11.49pm BST \n \n \n  11.39pm BST  \n  \n  Keneally says the government\u2019s response to the Respect@Work report has nothing concrete to \u201cback it up\u201d:  \n   \n   I welcome the fact the government has actually recognised this report exists and responded to it. There are things we welcome. Particularly there\u2019s no wrong door for someone to go through in terms of bringing forward a complaint about sexual harassment, there are changes here that are welcome.  \n   But, there\u2019s no legislation, there\u2019s no funding attached, there\u2019s no reporting mechanism, the devil here is in the detail.  \n   What do we see in 24 hours, that the prime minister\u2019s claiming he has accepted all the recommendations, it\u2019s been undercut by the sex discrimination commissioner herself when she said they missed the opportunity to shift from a culture of with all the responsibilities put on the complainant, to one where employers have to take a proactive approach to ensuring and working to ensure that sexual harassment and other forms of disrespect of women in the workplace do not occur. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.42pm BST \n \n \n  11.37pm BST  \n  \n  The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has attacked the government\u2019s response to the Respect@Work reports, labelling it a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d.  \n  The Morrison government released their response to the report into sexual harassment in Australia, and while some important changes were made \u2013 including victims now having two years to bring complaints forward rather than six months, and sexual harassment now being explicitly defined as a valid reason for dismissal \u2013 the government has only promised to \u201cassess\u201d one of the key recommendations which would make companies legally responsible for proactively preventing sexual harassment rather than committing to implementing it.  \n  Keneally appeared on ABC News Breakfast just before: \n   \n   I have to laugh at this. It\u2019s a rueful laugh, it\u2019s not one of joy. Because the government sat on this report for 12 months. They did not respond to it until they faced multiple crises and the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins in Parliament House.  \n   They have not consulted with business, they have not consulted with women\u2019s groups. Christian Porter had not even met with the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins.  \n   We saw her own words, this government\u2019s response is a missed opportunity. Not my words, Kate Jenkins\u2019s own words, the government \u2013 Scott Morrison goes out there yesterday, said I have accepted all these recommendations. We hear from Kate Jenkins he hasn\u2019t.  \n   As always with the prime minister, it\u2019s about the announcement, it\u2019s never about the plans, the follow through and the delivery. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.47pm BST \n \n \n  11.24pm BST  \n Dying Australian man finally home after 14 months trapped overseas \n  \n  Quickly there is some good news this morning! In fact great news!  \n  If you have been following along you might remember the Guardian has been reporting on John Jobber, a terminally ill Tasmanian man who has been trapped for the last 14 months in Ireland unable to get home.  \n  He visited the UK and Ireland in early 2020, intending to spend a few weeks with his daughter and say goodbye to old family and friends. But suddenly the pandemic broke out and Australia\u2019s borders were closed.  \n  His daughters, Samantha John in Melbourne and Michele Jobber in Ireland have been fighting tirelessly to get back to Tasmania to fulfil his final wish of dying peacefully at home. \n  But multiple attempts to fly to Melbourne were thwarted by lockdowns in both countries, and Victoria\u2019s stopping and starting approach to international flights and hotel quarantine.  \n  Well finally, after more than a year, Jobber touched down in South Australia last night and is now safety quarantining in an Adelaide hospital.  \n  Samantha said she was delighted to finally have him home:  \n   \n   It\u2019s been a rollercosters. I\u2019m relieved and anxious.  \n   \n  After Guardian Australia first reported on Jobber\u2019s situation, Qatar Airlines reached out to the family and helped them book new flights. The plan was Michele would fly to Australia with her father, who is suffering from severe dementia, to ensure he was safe and took his medication. They would land, he would go to hospital and she would get straight back on a plane to Ireland. \n  But, Samatha explained even hours before take-off, it still looked like they might not make it.  \n   \n   My sister was frantically finalising all the paperwork, packing, doing PCR tests and getting him to his last dialysis when a text came through just saying the flight was cancelled \u201cdue to operational reasons\u201d.  \n   We couldn\u2019t believe it. So she contacted [the families Qatar Airline representative] to ask why. He said \u201chold on I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d.  \n   Before he rang back an hour or so later, another text message had been received confirming the flight will go ahead as scheduled.  \n   He rang back and said there was no way THAT flight was going to be cancelled on his watch. \n   \n  Around 9 pm last night Jobber touched down, said a quick goodbye to Michele and was whisked off to hospital for quarantine and dialysis. \n  Now all that is left is for Samantha to get him back to his home: \n   \n   The baton has been handed to me to get him safely back to Tasmania via Victoria between dialysis sessions and then his ongoing care... \n   I\u2019m looking forward to a huge hug with him. \n   \n  You can read our previous coverage here:  \n   \n    Related: Victoria's coronavirus lockdown sabotages terminally ill Australian man's year-long fight to get home  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.52am BST \n \n \n  11.16pm BST  \n  \n  A number of different countries have issues of different ages for AstraZeneca advisories. Paul Kelly has been asked why Australia settled on \u201c50\u201d as the cut-off:  \n   \n   I can understand that people are interested in how those decisions have been made.  \n   It\u2019s important that local context* is taken into account and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened and has presumably influenced other advice. We have been in very close contact with our European colleagues at the European medicines association, the ATAGI equivalent as well in Europe as well as in the UK, the regulator and their immunisation advisory group, they have used exactly the same data as we have been using because most of these extremely rare events have happened in Europe and in the UK and that\u2019s where many millions of doses have been used of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  \n   It is the same data but taking into account local circumstances. We have chosen \u2013 the choice by the medical advisory group is 50. That\u2019s based on that risk-benefit equation** for the Australian circumstances. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with. \n   \n  * The local context is that the UK said \u201cunder 30\u2019s\u201d, but we had a 44-year-old man that suffered from non-fatal blood clotting, so have gone \u201cunder 50\u201d instead.  \n  ** Basically, while the 30 to 50 age bracket is slightly more susceptible to serious Covid-19, there is vastly less Covid-19 in Australia so they are still considered low risk.  \n  \n Updated at 11.35pm BST \n \n \n  11.09pm BST  \n  \n  Chief medical officer Paul Kelly seems reasonably confident that the vaccine rollout delay won\u2019t drastically change Australia\u2019s ability to live normally:  \n   \n   The Australian Health Protection Committee with the Chief Health Officer group that I chair has had really strong and meaningful and very good discussions about our reactions to outbreaks and so forth, including the issue of border closures, and that information will go to national cabinet today and will be discussed by the premiers and the prime minister and I\u2019ll be there to assist them. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.19pm BST \n \n \n  11.07pm BST  \n  \n  Paul Kelly has been asked if Australia needs to be making additional deals with international vaccine producers in order to make up for the shortfall:  \n   \n   All of those things are on the table. We are looking at all of those options right now.  \n   We know that Novavax, we have 51 million doses on order, but that\u2019s not yet approved by the TGA. We don\u2019t have the final components of their clinical trials but, when we do, the TGA, as it did with the other two vaccines we have been using in the last couple of months will absolutely expedite that matter and as soon as Novavax is ready to supply to Australia we will be going through those processes.  \n   In terms of Pfizer, as I say, we are talking to that company and we have been talking to that company. We continue to talk to that company and we\u2019ll see what transpires from those talks.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.10pm BST \n \n \n  11.06pm BST  \n  \n  Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly says the benefits of the vaccine program still \u201cfar outweigh the risks\u201d, urging the public not to lose confidence.  \n  He is speaking on ABC News Breakfast now:  \n   \n   Of course, something like the announcements overnight can affect vaccine confidence.  \n   As I said last night at the press conference, the important thing is for the Australian public to know that as soon as we\u2019ve known something, as soon as our expert advice from that ATAGI group that gives us the guidance on immunisation have given Australia a decision, we went out. It was within 15 minutes we told the nation about these matters and to follow through as we did until about midnight last night to make sure that GPs and other vaccine providers today have all that information to have those discussions with people who have concerns.  \n   For young people, and indeed for all Australians, the benefits of the vaccine program far outweigh any risks and that continues to be the case.  \n   We\u2019ve made this preference for not using AstraZeneca in the under 50s on the basis of that safety concern but vaccination in general is absolutely important and I would really urge people to make sure that they are lining up when their turn comes to get the appropriate vaccine. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.11pm BST \n \n \n  10.57pm BST  \n  \n  Morning all, Matilda Boseley, here. Let\u2019s not beat around the bush. We all know why you are here. Let\u2019s talk about AstraZeneca.  \n  At 7.15pm, the prime minister called a press conference to announce that the AstraZeneca vaccine is now not recommended for people under 50 years old, due to extraordinarily rare but potentially fatal blood clotting in younger people.  \n  There has been an extremely small number of cases of a specific type of blood clotting called \u201clow platelet blood clotting\u201d in people after they receive the AstraZeneca jab. This was generally in people under 50. This led to the EU declaring blood clotting should be listed as a possible but rare side effect, and caused the UK to recommend other vaccines to be used on people under 30 when possible.  \n  This prompted a review by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.  \n  Here is chief medical officer Paul Kelly explaining the recommendations: \n   \n   At the current time, the use of the Pfizer vaccine is preferred over the AstraZeneca vaccine in adults aged less than 50 years who have not already received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. This is based both on the increased risk of complications from Covid-19 with increasing age, and thus increased benefit of the vaccination, and the potentially lower, but not zero risk, of this rare event with increasing age.  \n   The second recommendation is that immunisation providers should only give the first dose of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to adults under 50 years of age where the benefit clearly outweighs the risk for that individual\u2019s circumstances.  \n   The third recommendation is people that have had their first dose of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca without any serious adverse events can safely be given their second dose. This includes adults under the age of 50. People who have had blood clots associated with low platelet levels after their first dose of Covid-19 AstraZeneca should not be given the second dose. \n   \n  Thank gosh our rollout doesn\u2019t rely almost entirely on the domestic production of AstraZeneca, pumping out 1m doses a week ... oh wait.  \n  There are about 12 million people aged between 18 and 49 who will now ideally be given the Pfizer vaccine, but Australia currently only has contracts for 20m doses, enough for 10 million people, and international supply chains are already unreliable.  \n  Basically the long and short of it is this is likely to create yet another extremely significant delay in Australia\u2019s already limping vaccine rollout.  \n  There is plenty of other stuff to look out for as well today, but why don\u2019t we jump into the day for now.  \n  Buckle in.  \n  If there is something you reckon I\u2019ve missed or think should be in the blog but isn\u2019t, shoot me a message on Twitter @MatildaBoseley or email me at matilda.boseley@theguardian.com. \n  \n Updated at 11.35pm BST \n", "Australia Post chairman rejects Christine Holgate\u2019s claims \u2013 as it happened [2021-04-07T09:00:08Z]": "  9.44am BST    What happened today, Wednesday 7 April 2021    It\u2019s been a huge day \u2013 here\u2019s what you need to know:  The International Monetary Fund has upgraded Australia\u2019s post-Covid economic outlook, but warns that recovery from recession still depends on the rollouts of coronavirus vaccines.   Speaking of which, the Morrison government continues to defend its bungled national vaccine rollout. A whopping 3.1m of the 3.8m AstraZeneca doses Australia pre-purchased from European suppliers have not been delivered.    Australia has hit 920,334 vaccinations, health minister Greg Hunt says (but, for context, Australia had planned to have 4 million people vaccinated by the end of March). Around 3,000 general medical practices are administering the vaccine.    The NSW government will open a vaccination hub in Homebush, in Sydney\u2019s inner west, capable of administering 30,000 doses a week to assist the federal government in the vaccine rollout.   The federal government will launch a national domestic violence survey tonight and will host a national women\u2019s safety summit in July. The announcement came after Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wrote to Scott Morrison this morning, calling for the government to convene a national summit to tackle gender inequality.   The Australian Electoral Commission is investigating Liberal National MP Andrew Laming over more than 30 Facebook pages he operates without any disclosure of his involvement, following the Guardian\u2019s investigation.

China\u2019s ambassador has cautioned Australia in imposing sanctions against its officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, warning that Beijing will respond \u201cin kind\u201d.    Women who were implanted with defective vaginal mesh products filed a new class action against pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiary Ethicon in the federal court today.

Tune in tomorrow morning for another day of news with the original, the best, Matilda Boseley. This is Justine Landis-Hanley signing off.    Updated at 10.00am BST     9.11am BST    Australia Post chairman rejects Christine Holgate's claims    The Australia Post chairman, Lucio Di Bartolomeo, has issued a statement contradicting much of what former CEO Christine Holgate submitted to the Senate inquiry about her removal for the gift of $20,000 of Cartier watches to senior executives. The central disagreement is whether Di Bartolomeo \u201cunlawfully\u201d stood Holgate down. Holgate claims she offered to take annual leave pending an investigation but resisted standing aside; Di Bartolomeo claims she stood aside voluntarily and therefore Holgate\u2019s claim that she was \u201cunlawfully\u201d stood down was not correct.  He said:  The agreement for Ms Holgate to stand aside was reached between myself and Ms Holgate in telephone discussions late that afternoon, in breaks during a board meeting that commenced at approximately 4pm. The board did not stand down, or suspend, Ms Holgate from her role \u2013 that being an unnecessary consideration given her agreement to stand aside. Ms Holgate claims that she did not speak with me that afternoon at all after question time (the relevant parts of which occurred between approximately 2.30pm and 2.40pm). However, phone records support my recollection \u2013 including that we had conversations at 4:27pm and 5.50pm on that day.  Di Bartolomeo rejects Holgate\u2019s claim she was not supported, citing support from the executive general manager of People &amp; Culture \u2013 \u201cconfidential and regular\u201d support which he said continued even after her resignation on 2 November. He also rejected her account about post-employment restrictions:  Ms Holgate claims that I made a counter-offer which would have prevented her from working for 12 months without pay. That is not correct. The existing provisions of Ms Holgate\u2019s contract of employment contained non-compete provisions, as is common for such senior executive roles. These provisions apply only to working for a competitor for a period of six months from the end of Ms Holgate\u2019s employment \u2013 and therefore expire on 2 May 2021.  The Senate inquiry has hearing scheduled for 13 April before it reports back on 30 April.      Updated at 10.36am BST     8.55am BST       The government announced a national women\u2019s safety summit around an hour ago, and already people are taking to Twitter to raise their concerns. The main fear is that this summit is just delaying real action against sexual assault and domestic violence.    A women\u2019s safety summit at the end of JULY. That seems urgent. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude21#auspol&mdash; Cheryl Kernot (@cheryl_kernot) April 7, 2021    The national survey on domestic violence, also announced this afternoon, has been criticised for similar reasons; the government already knows that frontline support services are overstretched and under-resourced and that urgent additional funding is required.    Hi @Anne_Ruston and @ScottMorrisonMP, respectfully, we don&#39;t need another survey on domestic violence. We already know the stats. Can you please just act instead?? Fund GBV service providers to an adequate level for starters - they urgently need $150m. #EnoughIsEnough&mdash; Kate Walton (@waltonkate) April 7, 2021    End Rape on Campus Australia founder and director, Sharna Bremner, warned against asking people to share their trauma without also providing additional resources to frontline services to support them.    But without any extra funding for support services?! This is incredibly irresponsible. You cannot ask people to share their trauma without also providing additional resources for support. https://t.co/lZ4nKJNvhz&mdash; Sharna Bremner (@sharnatweets) April 7, 2021         8.33am BST    China's ambassador warns against Australia imposing sanctions over rights abuses    China\u2019s ambassador to Australia has warning that Beijing will respond \u201cin kind\u201d if Canberra follows other countries in imposing sanctions against its officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The ambassador, Cheng Jingye, was speaking this afternoon at his official residence at an event that included a video hookup with officials in Xinjiang region and was intended to push back at growing international criticism of what some western countries have said amounts to genocide. During questions from Australian journalists, Cheng several times declined to comment in detail on the current low in the relationship between China and Australia, but said the \u201cdifficulties\u201d were not initiated by China. The ambassador was more forthcoming when asked what would happen if Australia followed the UK, EU, US and Canada in imposing sanctions against officials over the plight of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. (So far Australia has welcomed those sanctions, but has not immediately replicated them, partly because of the lack of Magnitsky-style laws that would allow swift targeted sanctions for human rights abuses.)    Cheng said China flatly rejected the allegations about what had happened on the ground in Xinjiang and that the sanctions imposed by other western capitals were a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international norms and were \u201cbased on disinformation or misinformation\u201d. He said people should not be under the illusion \u201cthat China would swallow the bitter pill\u201d of interference or meddling its internal affairs, nor attempts to mount a \u201cpressure\u201d campaign:  We will not provoke, but if we are provoked we will respond in kind.  We will have more coverage soon.    Updated at 8.47am BST     8.12am BST       Conversation turns to Scott Morrison\u2019s treatment of Christine Holgate, the former Australia Post chief executive, over her controversial gift of Cartier watches to senior executives.  McKenzie says Holgate\u2019s submission to a Senate inquiry that she was wrongly stood down raises a number of valid concerns.   I think it\u2019s important for Christine to have the opportunity to put her case on the public record, which the submission has done. And that we\u2019ll be able to prosecute next week as senators during the hearings so it is publicly transparent around these issues, and we will be able to prosecute obviously the department and talk to licensed post offices and the chair himself next...  Leigh compared the way Morrison lambasted Holgate at the time of the scandal to the way he has treated former attorney general Christian Porter.   If only Christine Holgate had got the sort of measured, thoughtful response to her decisions that Bridget outlined there. But she didn\u2019t. She got the prime minister thundering in the parliament \u201cShe can go\u201d. We know now that the independent inquiry started two hours after that. It is a complete contrast from the treatment of Christian Porter where the prime minister said he was entitled to the presumption of innocence and the rule of law. None of that applied to his treatment of Christine Holgate. This inquiry is going to bring to light not only the way in which the prime minister operates, but also the need for an overhaul of the Australia Post board. It is too important an organisation to be run like a Liberal party branch meeting.       Updated at 9.48am BST     8.01am BST       Moving on from the presser:  Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie and Labor MP Andrew Leigh are appearing on ABC News to talk about the government\u2019s just-announced women\u2019s safety summit.  First up: how hopeful are they that this could be something that leads to actual change? McKenzie says that \u201cit\u2019s exactly what women and men around the country have been calling for\u201d.   I have been saying for quite a few weeks now we need to have a bipartisan approach to dealing with the issue of sexual assault, harassment and violence against women and I\u2019m very proud to be part of a government that\u2019s called a national summit into women\u2019s safety, end of July. And I know governments of all colours will come together on that day to end violence against women and children. We have seen a lot of crime statistics go down over Covid-19, but the one appalling statistic that\u2019s gone through the roof is that of domestic violence. I\u2019m looking for ward to not just the budget and seeing initiatives announced that will support the economic empowerment and the safety of women and children, but also, I think, individuals saying as one that not more to that sort of behaviour.  Leigh says Labor will support the women\u2019s safety summit, but cautions that the government has a history of being all talk and no action when it comes to tackling gendered violence.   What we have seen in the parliament is the Coalition voting against Labor\u2019s call for there to be 10 days of domestic violence leave for victims, and instead putting forward a hare-brained idea that family violence victims dip into their own superannuation. This isn\u2019t just an issue of violence, it\u2019s also an issue of equity... But from Scott Morrison, we have got somebody who\u2019s consistently made cuts when he was treasurer and now as prime minister to these frontline services. They have got cuts coming down the pipeline as a result of the government\u2019s decisions.     Updated at 8.07am BST     7.53am BST       Finally, questions for Ruston turn to besiged Liberal National MP Andrew Laming.  The reporter is blunt:   You would like him to go?  Ruston is about as blunt as a politician can be when talking about one of their own, saying:  Look, I think we need to give Mr Laming a couple of weeks to reflect on that. I will be very interested in his response when he returns from that moment, that time of reflection... I think everybody in Australia thinks what\u2019s he has done is abhorrent.     Updated at 7.57am BST     7.50am BST       One reporter makes a good point: the government has had an eight-month inquiry into family sexual and domestic violence where it heard from experts about what should be done to tackle this national emergency. So why is the government only opening up discussion to the public now through this national survey? Ruston:   Well, of course, all the information that was contained if that inquiry will be very valuable for the development of the next plan. But we wanted to say to any Australian, as we go out and say that we are starting this formal consultation process specifically on the plan, if you want do have your say, there is a mechanism by which you can do it.  Some people may prefer the anonymity of being able to go online and just fill out a survey as opposed to making a formal submission to a committee.  So, we just want to make sure that we ... give every single Australian the opportunity to have their voice heard as we move towards the next plan. Because, as I said, it must be a very ambitious plan and we need for us to be able to inform the plan [with] the voices of every Australian.   I get the sentiment. But women\u2019s lives are on the line, and Ruston doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the question: if we already know what we need to do, why don\u2019t we just get on with it?    Updated at 7.55am BST     7.42am BST       Ruston is asked what kind of content the national women\u2019s summit will cover.  Reporter:   On the national summit, there are growing calls from your colleagues here and now from Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland to expand it to take in gender inequality, superannuation, the gender pay gap. Should the Morrison government consider facilitating a bigger summit than one that focuses just on women\u2019s safety?  Ruston:  The summit that we are talking about is a women\u2019s safety summit. It\u2019s principal purpose, as it was originally intended, back last year when we said that we were going to have a summit, which unfortunately wasn\u2019t able to go ahead because ofCOVID, was around informing the next national plan to end violence against women and their children. But the scope of the summit is obviously something that we will begin consultation with the state and territories over coming months. It is very focused around women\u2019s safety, and making sure that we have the best possible information base to be able to inform the next plan.   Reporter:  Would you be in favour of a second summit, a broader summit, that Annastacia Palaszczuk is flagging?  Ruston:   Look, certainly the issue of this particular summit is very focused around a single goal that we want to achieve. And that\u2019s informing the next plan and so that\u2019s what my focus is on at the moment.        7.35am BST       Ruston has been asked whether any additional funding has been discussed for frontline sexual assault and domestic violence services.  Frontline services wrote to the minister for women today asking for additional funding to keep up with the spike in family and domestic violence during the pandemic.  Ruston fell back on the government\u2019s talking points, speaking about the $150m made available to these services last year in response to the pandemic (yes, the very amount that frontline services says was insufficient to tackling this crisis). But Ruston said she understood that not all of this money had been spent.   The $150 million was paid directly to state and territory for them to be able to respond to demand in their individual state and territories. The last information that I have is that not all of the money has been spent.  I\u2019m looking forward to receiving the information from the state and territories about how much of that funding has been spent and also to receiving the data around where the demand has been for increased services to make sure that whatever we do into the future is targeted at initiatives that address the demand areas.     Updated at 7.42am BST     7.27am BST    Government to launch national domestic violence survey online tonight    Ruston says the government is also launching a national online survey tonight to ensure that its plan to end violence against women is informed by \u201cthe lived experience of people who have experienced domestic violence\u201d.  Today we start the consultation process. As part of that, there will be a number of consultation elements, including opening tonight a national online survey, where any Australian can have input into the next plan and provide us with information about their experiences. So, anybody who wants to commence or to be part of that process can go on to Engage at DSS and participate.      Updated at 8.01am BST     7.17am BST    Morrison government to host national women's safety summit in July    Social services minister Anne Ruston has announced that the government is planning a national women\u2019s safety summit to be held on 29 and 30 July this year. The announcement comes after Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wrote to Scott Morrison this morning, calling for the government to convene a national summit to tackle gender inequality.  Senator Ruston said:   I\u2019m pleased to announce that the summit will be held on the 29 and 30 July this year. As part of that, which will look at a number of issues, we need to inform the next plan and make sure that we get as many people together \u2013 as many stakeholders \u2013 so the next plan is informed by voices of all Australians.  This plan needs to be a very ambitious plan. We need to make sure that we move from just reducing violence against women and their children to ending violence against women and their children. We must have a goal towards zero and the next plan will be an ambitious blueprint to stop the rot that is domestic violence across our national landscape.       Updated at 8.08am BST     7.11am BST       Another presser! This time senator Anne Ruston is speaking to the media following today\u2019s meeting between federal and state women\u2019s ministers on violence against women and children.  More to come.

Updated at 6.56am BST     6.29am BST    Women launch new class action over defective vaginal mesh products    Women who were implanted with defective vaginal mesh products filed a class action against pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiary Ethicon in the federal court today. The women are being represented by Shine Lawyers.On 4 July 2017, a separate trial for Australia\u2019s largest product liability class action against Johnson &amp; Johnson began in Sydney, with thousands of women suffering painful and life-altering complications from the mesh implants. At the time, the court ordered that 4 July 2017 marked the cut-off for entry into this first class action against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Ethicon.The women excluded from that first class action because they received an implant after that cut-off date filed a second class action on Wednesday. The first class action resulted in the court ordering Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $2.6m in damages.Shine\u2019s class actions practice leader, Rebecca Jancauskas, said women excluded from the first action felt distressed that their suffering would not be recognised and they would not be eligible for compensation.She said:   We know there are thousands of women who were implanted with these defective products or who have developed complications after this date, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued to fight for justice for these women, so none are left behind.  Hundreds of women have been identified as potentially eligible group members in the new proceedings, and anyone who believes they are eligible has been urged to approach Shine.Women implanted with the pelvic floor mesh repair systems may have experienced symptoms of complications such as chronic pain, painful intercourse and incontinence. Jancauskas said:   These defective mesh products have eroded in some women\u2019s bodies, moving through tissue and penetrating or sticking to organs, causing debilitating chronic pain.       Updated at 6.49am BST     6.11am BST       Albanese, on Morrison\u2019s dismissal of Christina Holgate:  There is evidence attached to her submission \u2013 including the thank you cards that went with the watchers, signed by the chairman of the Australia Post board \u2013 that she was acting consistent with the response of the board, and consistent with the rules that were in place there.  Scott Morrison, of course, got rid of Christine Holgate on the floor of the House of Representatives in question time, and yet he stands by Andrew Laming.  Ask yourself, whose actions were worse? Those of Christine Holgate, providing watches, in my view, inappropriately but in accordance with previous practices of the Australia Post board, an organisation, over a period of time? Or Andrew Laming?  But Scott Morrison stands by Andrew Laming but dismissed Christine Holgate without an opportunity for her to put her case.     Updated at 6.24am BST     6.07am BST       Albanese is hitting all the talking points this afternoon, taking swipes at Morrison\u2019s handling of disgraced Liberal National MP Andrew Laming and former Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate.  On Laming, he says:   Andrew Laming should not be in the parliament and he should go today and the government should withdraw their support for him. I find it extraordinary that Scott Morrison says that he cares about issues relating to gender and he has, as someone in his Liberal party room, someone who he wrote to the pre-selectors of Bowman asking that they re-endorse him for the 2019 election, and Andrew Laming is someone who has harassed his own constituents, women, on Facebook and on social media.  He has harassed a woman\u2019s state member in Kim Richards and asked for people to basically report her whereabouts and what she is doing, and offered a cash and support prizes for people reporting that. He is someone who took a photo up a skirt of a woman at work in her place of work and, only when confronted, was forced to delete that from his mobile phone. He is someone who apologised in parliament on the last sitting day with just minutes to go on that sitting Thursday, and then on the Friday, the day after, said he didn\u2019t know what he had apologised for. This is a guy who is not fit to be in the parliament and Labor will reserve all options to take action when parliament resumes ... But quite frankly, while he sits in at the Liberal party room, Scott Morrison will have no ability on these issues.     Updated at 6.27am BST     6.04am BST       Albanese has brought up how Queensland premier, Labor\u2019s Annastacia Palaszczuk, this morning wrote to the prime minister asking the government to host a national women\u2019s summit to tackle gender inequality.  The opposition leader said he\u2019d only support the summit if Labor is invited.  I support that summit as long as it is not a controlled summit of Scott Morrison\u2019s friends being invited to not produce any great outcomes. As long as it is one of substance, not just of announcing the summit and then that is the end of the process. And with this government, so often we see it as the announcement of a process that is the end in itself rather than outcomes.  Albanese took the opportunity to criticise the meeting of Morrison\u2019s newly established women\u2019s cabinet taskforce on Tuesday.   Yesterday was a great example whereby the meeting that was held in the cabinet room didn\u2019t produce any outcomes. And to say that the government is now going to consider these issues. When I was a cabinet minister, cabinet submissions had within them an area that had to take into account what the impact on gender was of any policies coming forward. I would have thought that should have been just standard practice.     Updated at 6.08am BST     5.57am BST       One press conference ends, another one starts.  Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking in Launceston on his favourite topic: all the ways the federal government is failing right now. First up: Australia\u2019s bungled vaccine rollout.  We know that there was once shipment of a quarter of a million blocked from Europe. We know that occurred but we also know that is the only shipment that was blocked because that has been confirmed today, not just by the Europeans but by the Australian government itself.  Albanese swiftly segues to talk about how Morrison is failing women.  This is a government that has failed when it comes to delivering for 52% of the population. It has failed when it comes to women\u2019s services, dealing with domestic and family violence. It has failed when it comes to women\u2019s access to workforce participation through childcare support. It has failed when it comes to the gender pay gap of more than 13% that exist in this country. It has failed when it comes to women\u2019s superannuation, who retire with far less than their male counterparts. All of these issues need to be dealt with by the government...     Updated at 6.06am BST     5.44am BST       Reporters want to know whether the fact that Australia has fallen behind on its promise of 2m locally manufactured AstraZeneca doses by the end of March; is it a manufacturing problem or a Therapeutic Goods Administration approval problem?  The answer: manufacturing. Hunt:  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that. The approvals have been done on the same day that the data has been received. It might be valuable to talk people through these steps. There\u2019s the production or some might call it the brewing. Then there is the bottling, which is the fill and finish process. Then there is the external safety assessment and that does involve working with AstraZeneca, that\u2019s part of the international contracts which have been done around the world with AstraZeneca. And then once that is done, that\u2019s provided to the TGA and then the TGA assesses it. So far they have assessed and released on exactly the same day that they have been provided the data. Then that\u2019s distributed and the release for distribution has, again, occurred on the same day that the TGA\u2019s been provided the information. And then that is distributed around the country and then what we see is we\u2019re in constant continuous distribution. So, for example, that we have doses that have been in place which allowed us to get to the 920,000. We then have, from that, doses that have now been delivered for this week \u2013 over half a million for this week. And then doses that are being distributed over the coming days for next week again over half a million and then doses for contingencies.      Updated at 5.48am BST     5.38am BST    CSL has released 1.3m AstraZeneca vaccine doses, Hunt says    Back to our AstraZeneca supply, given that Australia is 3.1m doses short of its vaccine order from Europe, reporters want to know how the government\u2019s deal with CSL to make a 50m doses locally in 2021 is going.    Reporter:  Minister, on the CSL issue, this is a press release from the company in February: they said that they expected to release 2m doses of the vaccine by the end of March. Obviously it\u2019s April and we have had less than 1m actually released. What\u2019s gone wrong?  Hunt:  So actually we have had 1.3m releases of CSL. It comes through in batches so it\u2019s what we call a continuous release program \u2013 continuous release program...  The days might change, depending on their safety protocols and their assessments, but what we\u2019re expecting \u2013 because I know there have been some questions so I\u2019d thought I\u2019d prepare for that. We have received the 1.3m that have been cleared and then we\u2019re expecting later this week over 470,000.     Updated at 5.54am BST     5.34am BST       Hunt is also asked about how much Pfizer doses Australia has received from Europe.  So the Pfizer doses, I think, approximately 870,000. They have been very regular. They oscillate in a band between sort of just over 110,000 to a little bit above 150,000.  But they have been giving us good guidance in advance and that\u2019s been continuing and continuing on time.        5.28am BST       Hunt is also being asked to respond to reports that aged care workers are being denied their second Pfizer doses because their first jabs weren\u2019t recorded properly.  Hunt:  There was one report that we had of one facility where there was some additional dosage required. We have taken steps to make sure that will be made available to the \u2013 made available to the workers. And that\u2019s one of the things we do.  Everyday in a rollout of this size, there are reports and actions that are taken to immediately respond. So it\u2019s appropriate to ask, absolutely. And it\u2019s appropriate that we have been able to respond.     Updated at 5.32am BST     5.25am BST       But despite Hunt\u2019s attempts to put a positive spin on our below-expected vaccination numbers (our target was to hit 4m doses by the end of March), reporters are pressing on.  One wants to know when Hunt expects 1m jabs to be completed.  Hunt\u2019s response is ... vague:   So that\u2019s a figure that we\u2019ll reach soon. It will depend on post-Easter just the rate of which people are returning in practices and some of the larger vaccination clinics are scaling up. But the answer is very soon.  We\u2019ll reach that mark and then we\u2019ll just continue to roll the vaccines out and as we move over the course of the coming weeks to more than 4,000 practices.  Ah yes, GPs on Easter holidays: the real culprits behind vaccine delays. Nothing to do with the fact that Australia is missing 3.1m AstraZeneca doses from overseas.    Updated at 5.30am BST     5.17am BST    Australia hits 920,334 vaccinations, health minister Greg Hunt says    Hunt is now turning to talk about Australia\u2019s heavily criticised vaccine rollout.  He\u2019s focusing on the positives: Australia has just hit week three of its vaccine rollout, and has gone from 1,000 general medical practices administering the vaccine to around 3,000.   So that process is continuing and as part of that, the Tuesday numbers were 65,351 vaccinations around the country. That takes us to 920,334 vaccinations.  The states have done 485,000 vaccinations or 23,800 in the last 24 hours.     Updated at 5.21am BST     5.13am BST       Health minister Greg Hunt is speaking about Australia\u2019s performance during the pandemic, compared to the rest of the world.   We have seen 579,000 cases around the world in the last 24 hours and 11,500 lives lost. Another way to look at it is across the world cases this year already around the world and over 1.068 million lives lost ... or more than 500,000 cases a day on average during 2021 and 10,000 live lost a day on average during 2021.  So we are in an extraordinarily fortunate position by comparison.     Updated at 5.16am BST     5.08am BST       Health minister Greg Hunt is in Melbourne providing a Covid-19 update.  More to come.     Updated at 5.12am BST     4.51am BST       On the Australian government\u2019s request for 1m AstraZeneca doses to be made available for Papua New Guinea, a spokesperson for the European Union has told Guardian Australia this afternoon:   We confirm that the president of the European Commission has received a letter from the Australian prime minister on this topic and we will reply in due time.     Updated at 5.23am BST     4.47am BST       Finally some good news (for us, at least). Australia has ranked last on the international comparison of excess deaths figures for Covid-19. The same unfortunately cannot be said for Peru or the US.    NEW: just updated our excess deaths figures, including data into AprilIt\u2019s abundantly clear that Latin America is the hardest-hit region in the world, with the five highest excess death rates globally.

I\u2019ll be heading along to the event and will file news afterwards. But the 90-minute press conference is expected to include some sort of video hook-up with officials from the Xinjiang region, where China has been accused of gross human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. The Canadian and Dutch parliaments and the US government have described the situation in Xinjiang as genocide. The fact the Chinese embassy in Australia has arranged this event suggests it is eager to push back at the growing international criticism of what is going on in Xinjiang. Chinese officials have previously argued that its conduct in Xinjiang is \u201cabove board\u201d. Morrison did not comment specifically on Xinjiang in this morning\u2019s presser, but said the world was \u201ca lot more uncertain at the moment than it has been for a long time\u201d. The prime minister said while he wanted a positive relationship with China, Australia would also act \u201cin accordance with its values and its national character \u2013 and that will never be, that will never be something that we would yield for the sake of a relationship\u201d.    Updated at 4.44am BST     4.26am BST       Frontline domestic and sexual violence services in New South Wales and Queensland have written today to the federal government calling for an additional $150m injection of funds to state and territories to deal with the spike in family and domestic violence during the pandemic. The move comes ahead of federal, state and territory women\u2019s safety ministers meeting today to discuss the issue of violence against women. Minister for women Marise Payne also said yesterday that the government was developing an \u201cambitious\u201d package of measures to help women ahead of the next budget.  But frontline services have made it clear that they don\u2019t want government talk, they want action.  Women\u2019s Safety NSW CEO, Hayley Foster, said:  Violence against women is at crisis point in this country. We need a more ambitious National Plan to address this epidemic, but we can\u2019t wait until 2022 to act... Words and promises won\u2019t help women and children who need to escape right now and over the next 12 months.  Dr Alison Evans, spokesperson for the Centre for Women\u2019s Safety and Wellbeing said:  The Covid-19 pandemic has amplified pre-existing issues for specialist family, domestic and sexual violence services working with victim-survivors. It has created a marked increase in demand for services and growing complexity of what client\u2019s need.  Additional funding provided to these services to assist with the response was welcomed by the sector in 2020. This was a start, but more funding is urgently needed to account for the pandemic\u2019s ongoing effects on the levels of family, domestic and sexual violence across the community.     Updated at 4.33am BST     4.02am BST    Australia needs to manage China relationship and diversify export markets \u2013 report    Australia needs to manage the increasingly complex relationship with China, even as the government seeks areas to diversify its export markets, according to a new report out this afternoon. The Asia Taskforce \u2013 which includes the Business Council of Australia and Asia Society Australia \u2013 calls for a target of boosting Australia\u2019s exports to 35% of GDP by 2030 (up from 29% in 2019).    The report says Australian business now \u201cstands at a crossroads\u201d. It says not since the 1970s, when the UK turned towards Europe, \u201chave we witnessed a major re-alignment in how we trade and invest in the world\u201d. The taskforce, which also involves consultants PwC and the University of Sydney\u2019s business school, argues the disruption of Covid-19 also brings forward stark choices, as \u201cprotectionist policies that seemed unthinkable a year ago are creeping back\u201d.  Popular support for the open economy cannot be taken for granted. Retreating to old familiar relationships in western markets, falling behind in Asia literacy and failing to build connections with new Asian business partners should not be seen as a serious default choice when consumption in Asia will likely fuel future global growth.  The report backs the need to diversify Australia\u2019s export markets, but says this does not mean abandoning the economic relationship with China, the largest trading partner. It says diversification for Australia means trading with China will also build up other relationships in the region. The report \u2013 titled A second chance: How Team Australia can succeed in Asia \u2013 says that \u201clearning to navigate a more complex relationship with China is imperative and efforts to ensure both countries engage constructively must be a priority\u201d. Other recommendations include adopting a \u201cTeam Australia\u201d approach to developing new opportunities; play to our strengths by adopting country sector strategies; rebooting Asia literacy; and championing the talent in our Asian-Australian and diaspora communities. The trade minister, Dan Tehan, is expected to launch the report at an event in Canberra later today.    Updated at 4.20am BST     3.51am BST       The Greens are once again calling for an independent rapid review into the vaccine rollout to identify any issues and restore public confidence. Senator Rachel Siewert, Greens spokesperson for health, said in a statement:  With targets missed, persistent problems with vaccine supply, and troubles getting the available vaccines to where they\u2019re needed, the rollout of these vital jabs hardly inspires confidence... We shouldn\u2019t let this devolve into a game of finger pointing and blaming shifting between the federal and state governments. This pointless squabble doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in the rollout, and can only serve to add further delays to the process. An urgent, rapid and independent review into the vaccine rollout problems will find improvements to speed up the rollout, reassure the public that the process is going as well as can be, and take the politics out of the response.

Here\u2019s what you need to know from the last few hours:  Prime minister Scott Morrison took to the press to clear up comments around Australia\u2019s vaccine troubles yesterday, saying he did not criticise the EU. Morrison had said Australia was facing a supply problem, and that 3.1m out of 3.8m doses had not made it into the country.   Morrison has also declined to comment on accusations from former Australia Post chief executive Christine Holgate. Holgate alleges that Morrison threw her under the bus last October after it was revealed that Australia Post gave luxury watches to four senior executives as a reward for clinching a banking deal.    Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has called for a national women\u2019s summit to address domestic violence, the pay gap and other gendered issues, following the meeting of the new national cabinet \u201cwomen\u2019s taskforce\u201d. She has written to  Morrison offering to host the summit in Queensland.   NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said the NSW government will set up a vaccination hub in Homebush capable of administering 30,000 doses a week to assist the federal government in the vaccine rollout. It will be operational in a couple of months.   The Australian Electoral Commission has confirmed that it will investigate disgraced Liberal National MP Andrew Laming over more than 30 Facebook pages that he operates without any disclosure of his involvement. This comes following a Guardian investigation on Tuesday, which revealed Laming has set up dozens of Facebook pages under the guise of community and news groups, including one that poses as a fake education institute. Awkward.   Rugby league great Tommy Raudonikis has sadly passed away, aged 70, after a long battle with cancer.

The NGO is now launching a series of targeted radio ads across the country to try and clear up exactly how Covid-19 spreads, and how to reduce the risk of contracting the disease. Save the Children PNG Country Manager, Gerry Dyer, described the situation on the ground:  What we are seeing in PNG is a tsunami of misinformation about the virus and the vaccine that will cost lives... People may encounter a social media post containing misinformation, and then repeat it in the real world as established fact. This is dangerous when accurate information is key to stopping the spread of the virus... Radio works well in countering misinformation as people trust the medium and it is accessible to remote communities. The misinformation is coming from every direction and spreading faster than the virus itself.     Updated at 3.01am BST     2.51am BST       Thanks Matilda!

This has not yet been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia.  McGregor told theABC the move to push him out was \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201ctawdry\u201d:   A complaint has been made to the Labor party by a person in relation to two text messages I sent seven years ago. Though it does not allege sexual misconduct or sexual harassment, its purpose is appallingly clear. The complaint seems to pervert and weaponise the current justified public outrage at the treatment of women in this country for selfish, tawdry and political purposes.     Updated at 2.45am BST     2.32am BST       ABC Hobart is reporting that the Tasmanian Labor candidate Ben McGregor has resigned from his candidacy over \u201cinappropriate\u201d text messages.

Updated at 2.45am BST     2.27am BST    Laming to be investigated by electoral commission over 30 Facebook pages    The Australian Electoral Commission has confirmed that it will investigate Liberal National MP Andrew Laming over more than 30 Facebook pages that he operates without any disclosure of his involvement. As reported by us on Tuesday, Laming has set up dozens of Facebook pages under the guise of community and news groups, including one that poses as a fake education institute. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, political authorisation is required for \u201cinformation that is a matter communicated, or intended to be communicated, for the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election\u201d:  This includes, but is not limited to, a communication that expressly promotes or opposes a candidate, political party, member or senator.  The disclosure laws, which were updated after the 2016 election, also explicitly include social media posts, requiring authorisation details either in the message or through the page\u2019s biography details. Laming is on leave for clinical and empathy counselling after revelations that he stalked two Brisbane women online and took a photograph of a woman\u2019s bottom with her underwear exposed.

Updated at 2.33am BST     2.26am BST    NSW vaccine hub to be operational in  'couple of months'    Golly gosh the NSW government loves to condescendingly offer help to the federal government. I\u2019m only including about 20% of these comments in the blog and it\u2019s still overwhelming!  Brad Hazzard as gone in for another dip when asked if the new vaccine hub would be used to supplement the GP vaccine network:  I just said that first and foremost the federal government are rolling out to their area of responsibility through GPs and through Aboriginal health service as well in New South Wales and GPs are certainly the frontline and will remain the frontline.  What the New South Wales government is saying is we are here to help you achieve the targets that you thought the commonwealth could do but for various reasons haven\u2019t yet been achieved. We are there to support you*. We will have this mass vaccination centre available. Leases are being signed in the very near future and then there will be lot of work \u2013 it is not just a case of walk in and start vaccinating, there is a lot of infrastructure that has to be provided and that should be up and running within the next couple of months or so depending on vaccine availability and we\u2019ll get more information on that.  *Oooooft that\u2019s gotta hurt.    Updated at 3.40am BST     2.19am BST       Brad Hazzard has been asked if, in retrospect, cancelling Bluesfest in Byron Bay was overkill, given that only one case has been discovered in the area in the last week:  The decisions that were taken and are taken all the time are based on our best public health advice. I don\u2019t think anybody in Australia could say that we don\u2019t have \u2013 I think we have \u2013 the best chief health officer in the country and the best public health team, and we take advice on that basis.  If we had not made that decision we may be standing here today trying to explain why we had hundreds, if not thousands, of people who actually did have Covid. It is always good to be able to say that we got a very positive outcome from the decision that was taken.  Reporter:  Is there an update with the organisers about when it might be able to be held?  Hazzard:  A lot of work going on behind the scenes with Peter Noble and with Bluesfest.  I\u2019m really keen to see the Bluesfest come back on and I think there are a lot of us in the community are keen to see it come back on but that has to be worked through by Peter and it is a big challenge. It was a very big festival that he was going to be having and I\u2019m sure it will be on again sometime hopefully this year.     Updated at 2.32am BST     2.12am BST       NSW health minister Brad Hazzard says Australians need to get in the habit of using QR codes to prepare for international borders eventually opening:   At some point, our international borders will open up \u2013 at some point well down the track \u2013 at that point if we are still not in the habit of using those QR codes and understanding the significance of being able to track and trace and head off any outbreaks then we could face further issues.     Updated at 2.30am BST     2.09am BST       Gladys Berejiklian is going to great efforts to future proof her statements, given that we know it\u2019s a dangerous game committing to hard and fast numbers when it comes to vaccines.  The NSW premier is making it very clear from the outset if the state falls short, it\u2019s on the federal government\u2019s shoulders:   Can I also make this really critical point \u2013 our ability to do 60,000 vaccinations a week depends on us getting the supply of the vaccine from the commonwealth.  At the end of the day, the commonwealth is responsible for getting the vaccine to the states. They\u2019re responsible for making sure we have those doses to be able to give out and as you also know, the New South Wales government is incredibly proud of our record ... But our ability to complete the 300,000 that we had responsibility for in addition to doing the 60,000 extra a week is dependent on the commonwealth getting us those doses.     Updated at 2.29am BST     2.06am BST    Mass vaccination hub to be established in Sydney's inner west    Gladys Berejiklian says the NSW government will set up a vaccination hub in Homebush capable of administering 30,000 doses a week to assist the federal government in the vaccine rollout:  Firstly the New South Wales government is already in the process of establishing a 100 sites across the state to provide access to the vaccine. One hundred sites, around 80 of them are already up and running, and this is to make sure that everybody in rural and regional New South Wales as well as other locations outside of Sydney can get access to the vaccine to complement the GP network.  As we know, the federal government has the responsibility for making sure everybody is vaccinated ... In addition to those 100 sites the New South Wales government will also be setting up a vaccination hub at Homebush and this is to allow us to support the commonwealth in distributing the vaccine once we have finished the 300,000 that we said we would do ... So the New South Wales government, even after we\u2019ve done the 300,000 we were asked to do, we\u2019ll continue to have 100 sites up and running across the state in addition to a mass vaccination hub at Homebush. We anticipate that post-the 300,000 that we are responsible for we will be able to do around 60,000 vaccinations a week, half will be done at Homebush and the other half across the other 100 sites across.

But on March 5 your health minister said, when Italy\u2019s 250,000 doses were blocked: \u201cWe are very clear that this does not affect the pace of the rollout.\u201d  Morrison:  We\u2019d already adjusted the rollout. We\u2019d already adjusted the rollout to not include the 3.1m.  Now Daniel has very kindly tracked down that quote from health minister Greg Hunt on 5 March when the blocked AZ shipment became public:  I would note there are reports today of one particular shipment from one particular country, which has not been given \u2013 authorised to proceed from the particular country. And the European Commission accepted that advice from Italy.   We are very clear that this does not affect the pace of the rollout. That shipment had not been factored in to our distribution, to the states and territories.  And in fact, we received the first shipment of AstraZeneca this week of 300,000 doses. And AstraZeneca has a deep, broad global supply chain. And we have indeed been reassured that they will continue to draw on that deep, broad global supply chain. So I think that\u2019s important reassurance for every Australian. It is a reminder, it\u2019s a very, very, very competitive world.

In a blue jersey, Tommy Raudonikis never gave the @QLDmaroons an inch but we loved his passion and his commitment, and we welcomed him when he made his home in Queensland.My condolences to his family at this sad time.@NSWBlues @NRL https://t.co/UQuwmrQOnS&mdash; Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) April 7, 2021      Updated at 1.50am BST     1.44am BST       Scott Morrison has been asked whether if AZ doses aren\u2019t able to come from the EU, if Australia will offer PNG a portion of our domestically produced vaccine:  We obviously want those million doses and that\u2019s why I started today\u2019s media conference to say that, given statements made overnight, that apparently there is no obstruction to that and then I would hope that that could be readily addressed.  If that doesn\u2019t occur, then we have been working with a number of other partners around the world to see how we can address that. And we\u2019re also considering what it might mean for Australia\u2019s provision of doses directly. But those issues haven\u2019t been finalised yet.     Updated at 1.49am BST     1.40am BST       Scott Morrison is asked if the government is being \u201coverly rosy\u201d about the state of the vaccine rollout. He says no:  We had already taken into account, and we\u2019d already shared with this very gallery, in this very place in late January, the concerns that we had about the European distribution at that point. And I\u2019ve gone through the timeline again with you.  I mean, I think what I\u2019d urge the media to do is \u2013 circumstances change. There are a lot of variables in this process. Supply chains get disrupted. Medical evidence comes forward which requires us to address it, and may cause us to make changes to the program in the interests of public health ... Even when we released numbers in early January, we flagged that this is conditional on events and events will have a way of impacting on the distribution and rollout of the vaccination program ... We have our clear target and that is to get through 1a and 1b by midyear and to have offered to Australians, that first dose for adult Australians by the end of October. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working to. It is obviously subject to supply issues, medical evidence and medical advice and we will continue working on both of those principles.  So just breaking down that logic for a second \u2013 there are major issues with the supply chain and the rollout, and because the government acknowledges those issues we are apparently not allowed to criticise the rollout any more?     Updated at 1.43am BST     1.34am BST       Brendan Murphy says the TGA and health departments are still working closely to analyse if a case of non-fatal blood clotting in a 44-year-old man had any link to the AZ vaccine:   One case is not a strong signal but we are working very closely with our counterparts in the UK who have now done well over 18m doses of this vaccine, and in Europe, that have done many million, to look at the data that they\u2019re getting from their signals and their regulatory body and their vaccine advisory committees and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to give us the true picture of whether this is a real problem, and whether it has any significance ... There is a lot of action at the moment analysing the information in Europe and in the UK and we are taking a very close interest in it, because the government and the department have taken the view that safety is absolutely paramount ...  Europe has better data and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at their data to see whether this is a real problem and whether we need to do anything about it. At the moment, we don\u2019t have those answers.     Updated at 1.35am BST     1.29am BST    Morrison declines to comment on Holgate accusations    Scott Morrison has also been accused this week by former Australia Post chief executive Christine Holgate of throwing her under the bus over a scandal last October where it emerged Australia Post gave luxury watches to four senior executives in November 2018 as a reward for clinching a banking deal.     Former Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP    In a fiery speech to parliament, Morrison described the transaction as \u201cdisgraceful and not on\u201d and said Holgate could \u201cgo\u201d if she refused to stand down amid an inquiry into the affair. But a federal government-backed report released in January found \u201cno indication of dishonesty, fraud, corruption or intentional misuse of Australia Post funds\u201d, but labelled the purchase inconsistent with public service obligations. Morrison was asked if he has a response to her recent comments:  I\u2019m aware of the comments and those submissions and I understand that they\u2019ll be addressed through the parliamentary hearing.  This is a matter now that\u2019s substantively between Ms Holgate and Australia Post and that\u2019s where I note the predominance of the comments have been directed.  Ms Holgate decided to leave Australia Post. That\u2019s just a matter of record. There was a review that was undertaken into the matters that were brought up by the Senate at estimates, and before that was concluded, Ms Holgate decided to leave Australia Post.  That\u2019s just a matter of record and these issues now are between Ms Holgate and Australia Post and I\u2019ll leave that matter for the time being.     Updated at 1.41am BST     1.22am BST       According to Scott Morrison the states and the federal government are getting along great, although I\u2019m not sure he has been listening closely to the states if he reckons that\u2019s the case.  Reporter:   Trust in the government is critical for Australians to actually take up the vaccine. In recent weeks we\u2019ve seen blame-shifting with the states. We\u2019re now bickering with the EC about supply issues and, along with the issues with blood clotting, which still remains unclear to a lot of people. Are you concerned that the government\u2019s handling of this may contribute to vaccine hesitancy among the population? And what are you going to do about that?  Morrison:   No, I\u2019m not. And I think much of the conflation of the issues you\u2019ve raised, I think, is more in appearance than in fact. I mean, all I\u2019ve simply done today is set out very clearly that 3.1m vaccines didn\u2019t arrive in Australia. That\u2019s just a simple fact. It\u2019s not a dispute. It\u2019s not a conflict. It\u2019s not an argument. It\u2019s not a clash. It\u2019s just a simple fact.  And I\u2019m simply explaining to the Australian public that supply issues is what\u2019s constraining and has constrained, particularly over the recent months, the overall rollout of the vaccine.  Look, it happens before every single national cabinet. You all write stories about how everybody is disagreeing with each other and we come to national cabinet as always and I\u2019ll stand before you on Friday and talk about the things that are agreed.  So I would just counsel people to see these things sometimes as maybe a lot more dust being kicked up than actual substance. People are working together to deliver these vaccines.      Updated at 1.31am BST     1.19am BST       A reporter has asked Scott Morrison why the CSL plant that produces our domestic AZ doses hasn\u2019t ramped up to producing 1m doses a week yet:   I mentioned yesterday that we already achieved more than 800,000. That\u2019s something that we already achieved. The numbers vary from week to week and we\u2019ve just gone through the Easter period, so that influences the numbers at this precise point in time.  But they\u2019ve already been able to demonstrate the capacity to get over 800,000 produced in a week. And that\u2019s what I believe at least is achievable going forward and we would like to achieve more than that. But the idea of just throwing more money at it \u2013 that doesn\u2019t increase the volume.  This is a manufacturing process and the rate of production is very much in the hands of the manufacturing company themselves, CSL. But everyone is doing everything that they possibly can to get that to the best number possible.     Updated at 1.30am BST     1.17am BST       Brendan Murphy says Australia is only holding doses back if they are necessary for back-up:   There are no doses that are in reserve, as you put it. We have a second dose contingency of Pfizer vaccines that we\u2019ve kept in the warehouse waiting to be rolled out three weeks later. Every dose of AstraZeneca, we\u2019re keeping some of those and building a second-dose contingency.  Every other dose is in the process of being pre-deployed or deployed to be in a GP\u2019s surgery the week before it is given and it takes a week to get there.  So there are probably over a million doses in transit being put into position, but there is nothing that is not being allocated to be put in an arm.  That\u2019s to be absolutely clear \u2013 there is nothing sitting in a cupboard other than something that we\u2019re planning to give three weeks later as a second dose.     Updated at 1.19am BST     1.13am BST       Brendan Murphy, the former chief medical officer who is now the secretary of the federal health department, is speaking now:   So the point that I want to make again is that our vaccine rollout is going well*.  The only thing that is limiting the rollout is vaccine supply, and obviously, the initial issue with vaccine supply related to that 3.1m doses of AstraZeneca which really put us back in those first weeks because we didn\u2019t have those doses.  Now that we do have the CSL doses, which are starting to increase progressively, that is the right limiting step is the international supply of Pfizer and the amount that we\u2019re getting out of CSL, which was progressively increasing.  *It is not.     Updated at 1.18am BST     1.10am BST       Scott Morrison has broken down, in considerable detail, the communications between Australia, AstraZeneca and the EU:  In late January, the EC introduced strict export controls which were further expanded on March 24.  In late January, mid to late January, AstraZeneca provided updated advice that only 1.2m of the 3.2m offshore manufactured product could be delivered in February and in March. That was 500,000 in February and 700,000 in March.  That was because a range of issues, which included not just the vaccine shortage in Europe and AstraZeneca\u2019s awareness of the increasing restrictions on export controls, and so applications were not made for those 3.8m doses.  In fact, an application was made for 500,000 doses to be released. And in February, that application was made. Those 500,000 doses were being manufactured in Italy. On February 19 minister Hunt called the EU health minister to advocate for the release of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia. On February 20, AstraZeneca was advised by the European Commission to withdraw their application and submit a revised application for 250,000 doses manufactured in Italy ...  Consequently, an application was made for 250,000 doses out of what was to be 500,000 doses, and on March 3 the European Union denied export of those 250,000 doses to Australia.  On March 15, Minister Hunt wrote to them to review their decision to deny exports of vaccines to Australia. On March 17 I wrote to the president of the EC requesting the export of 1m doses from our original 3.8m which were originally for Australia, to make sure that we could make available to Papua New Guinea to deal with the humanitarian crisis that was emerging in that country. We have still not received any response to that request.  Minister Hunt wrote to AstraZeneca Global to request them to resubmit their export application to the EC for further doses and we have been seeking further calls with the president of the EC to discuss these matters. Now, I am pleased to hear that the European Union overnight has indicated that they are not seeking to restrict these vaccines to Australia.     Updated at 1.17am BST     1.06am BST       Scott Morrison says he will write to AstraZeneca again, asking it to help push through 1m more doses:   So I\u2019ll be very pleased, as will the minister, to write, again, in parallel, both to AstraZeneca, to seek the export licences for the full amount of the doses, the 3.8m, to be provided to Australia. And I can assure you that the first million of those will be used to support the humanitarian effort that we\u2019re putting in place for Papua New Guinea.     Updated at 1.08am BST     1.03am BST       OK, just before we go on here are Scott Morrison\u2019s comments from yesterday:  The challenges Australia have had has been a supply problem. It is pure and simple. There was over 3m doses from overseas that were that never came.  And that\u2019s obviously resulted in an inability to get 3m overdoses out and distributed through the network. I think it is really important that these points are made very clearly when we are talking about the rollout of the vaccine.     Updated at 1.07am BST     12.59am BST    Morrison says he never blamed EU for vaccine troubles    Scott Morrison says he did not criticise the EU when he spoke publicly yesterday:   First of all, I want to stress that at no time yesterday did I make any comment about the actions of the European Union, nor did I indicate any of the background reasons for the lack of supply that we have received from those contracted doses.  And so, any suggestion that I, in any way, made any criticism of the European Union yesterday would be completely incorrect.  I simply stated a fact \u2013 that 3.1m of the contracted vaccines that we had been relying upon in early January when we\u2019d set out a series of targets did not turn up in Australia. That is just a simple fact.  Now that fact has been the key reason for the early phases of the supply in the rollout in the vaccine. It\u2019s straightforward maths: 3.1m out of 3.8m doses did not come to Australia. That obviously had a very significant impact on the early rollout of the vaccination program until we got into a position when the domestically produced AstraZeneca vaccine would be in place.     Updated at 1.06am BST     12.57am BST       Scott Morrison is speaking now.  He has started by offering his condolences to the family of former PNG East Highlands governor Malcolm Smith who died in a Queensland hospital after contracting the disease in PNG.  He has also offered his sympathies to the family of rugby legend Tom Raudonikis:  He was one of the game\u2019s biggest characters and will be sadly missed in the rugby league family, and sincere condolences to his family and to the rugby league family as well.      Updated at 1.04am BST     12.50am BST       Scott Morrison seems to be going for dramatic effect by keeping us all in suspense waiting for his press conference.     Updated at 12.53am BST     12.49am BST       There is so much we don\u2019t know about the Australian vaccine rollout that we don\u2019t even know what we don\u2019t know any more.  Luckily, my esteemed colleague Christopher Knaus has us covered and has broken down the six biggest question marks still hanging over the rollout.  Here is just one, the volume produced by local manufacturing:   This is a critical question. Australia\u2019s vaccine strategy is heavily dependant on local manufacturing of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Yet, we currently do not know how many doses CSL is manufacturing per day or per week. Morrison has previously said it was making about 900,000 per week. That figure is wrong, according to CSL. The acting chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, was unable to answer the question on Monday during a press conference. \u201cSo, I can\u2019t actually give you the figures. But we\u2019re happy to check those and get them to you out of session there,\u201d he said. Follow-up questions from the Guardian have not yet yielded a response. Morrison said on Tuesday he was hoping for 800,000 per week but it would be misleading to provide current averages because it was too early in the manufacturing program.

She was out here, I think from memory, for the Commonwealth Games which was just over three years ago. I know she does like holidaying here.  She has a very busy job but hopefully she can come here in the not-too-distant future and experience all the beautiful things that Queensland has to offer.     Updated at 12.30am BST     12.17am BST    Queensland offers to host a national women\u2019s summit    Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has called for a national women\u2019s summit to address domestic violence, the pay gap and other gendered issues.  This comes after a meeting of the new national cabinet \u201cwomen\u2019s taskforce\u201d, and a virtual meeting will be held with all state ministers for women today.  It appears Palaszczuk thinks this is not enough and plans to write to Scott Morrison, encouraging him to hold a full summit:  Back in 2016, when I was the only woman on Coag, I actually asked, back then, the Coag leaders to support my proposal to have a national summit on the prevention of domestic and family violence ... I actually think the time is now right for our country to have a national women\u2019s summit. This is really important. To look at gender inequality, to look at economic inequality, to look at actions to address the gender pay gap, actions to address the superannuation gap, issues around addressing issues of affordable childcare. This is a huge issue for women out there in our community.  Time and time again my sisters have told me and other members of the community how expensive it is for childcare when you\u2019re working as well. These are really big issues in terms of women\u2019s equality. I also think issues of sexual harassment in the workplace is really important. But what we have seen over the last few months is a huge wave of support for women to have their voices heard and I think the time is now right to have a national women\u2019s summit. So I will be writing to the prime minister today \u2013 I will be asking the other leaders to support this. I am happy to host it here in Queensland or it can be in Canberra. That can be at the prime minister\u2019s discretion but I think the time is now right.

Updated at 12.15am BST     12.03am BST       Protesters have tried to blockade a rail construction site at the controversial Carmichael coalmine project in central Queensland this morning, AAP reports.  A group of health workers called Health on the Frontlines is protesting against the mine due to the impacts of coalmining and the climate crisis on human health. A group of about 20 people tried to block vehicles entering a rail construction site off the Gregory Highway. The mining company Bravus said the attempted blockade had not affected work. \u201cPolice have been notified and are on their way,\u201d the company said. A protester, University of Queensland associate professor Liza Fitzgerald, said climate change was the No 1 public health issue for the current generations and those to come:  I have to do his protest as a role model for my daughters and my students \u2013 we cannot have any more climate destruction, we cannot have more coal coming out of the earth.  A UQ senior research assistant Troy Combo, a Bundjalung man, also took part in the protest to bring attention to the impacts on Indigenous health:  I know that for Aboriginal people, health and wellbeing and connection to country are inseparable. So to hear about native title being extinguished here made me realise the need to come to the frontline and address climate change directly.   Frontline Action on Coal, which is promoting Wednesday\u2019s protest, noted that the the Australian Medical Association had declared climate change a health emergency in 2019.

The former prime minister was dropped from the roll after a public stoush with deputy NSW premier and Nationals leader John Barilaro over coal. Essentially Turnbull publicly said there should be no new coalmines in NSW on ABC radio, and Barilaro was furious.  Yesterday Kean, a Liberal, put out a statement dropping Turnbull from the board, saying it was important the focus of the role was on \u201cfacts, technology, science and economics\u201d, not personality. Now Kean has gone on ABC radio giving off the air of someone who really didn\u2019t want to sack his mate, and basically admitted he had to do it to appease the Nationals:  I believe in Malcolm Turnbull. I believe that he has a great skillset that would have made a huge difference in this very important area of public policy.  I chose him because I thought he was eminently qualified to do the job. I still believe he is eminently qualified to do the job but it\u2019s not just about having the right person, it\u2019s also about managing the politics and bringing people along on the journey and Malcolm Turnbull does alienate some sections of the community.  I don\u2019t agree with that view but in order to move forward in order to keep reducing our emissions in the way we have in New South Wales, I need to bring the whole community along this journey.     ABC RN host Hamish Macdonald pointed out it was \u201cno secret [Kean] and John Barilaro don\u2019t get along very well\u201d and asked if there had been \u201cquite a stink\u201d between the two of them of the Turnbull situation. Kean replied:  Not at all. I mean, John is a robust voice for the bush. I need to work with John in order to get things done and it\u2019s about finding a balance between keeping jobs and opportunities in the bush and that balance between needing to reduce our emissions.  That\u2019s something that has been able to be delivered in New South Wales, it\u2019s how we\u2019ve delivered the energy roadmap which is the biggest renewable energy plant in the country. I\u2019ve been able to do that by bringing people like John on the journey.      Updated at 12.14am BST     11.31pm BST       Oh my good lord, there are too many interviews about the AstraZeneca vaccine this morning and somehow every minister is saying a different thing!  Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on ABC News Breakfast that the EU has in fact blocked the 1m doses Australia is trying to procure for Papua New Guinea ... or it has at least \u201cnot approved it\u201d, which Frydenberg says is basically the same thing:  What we have before the EU is a request for a million vaccines to go to Papua New Guinea as a humanitarian act, because they\u2019ve had an outbreak. We know that they blocked our initial 250,000 vaccine request and initially we wanted to put in a request for 500,000 of those vaccines to come to Australia. And they blocked those.  And what the EU have said both publicly and privately is that they\u2019ll not be exporting the vaccine until they\u2019ve met their domestic needs. Now, that\u2019s what they\u2019ve said. So the fact that they\u2019re not giving approval is effectively the same as blocking.

It says multi-speed recoveries are under way in all regions but with stark differences in the pace of vaccine rollout, the extent of economic policy support and structural factors, such as reliance on tourism:  The outlook presents daunting challenges related to divergences in the speed of recovery both across and within countries and the potential for persistent economic damage from the crisis.  In it latest World Economic Outlook it is now projecting a stronger recovery for the global economy in 2021 and 2022 compared with its previous predictions made in January.

The government has also accused the European Commission of \u201carguing semantics\u201d by saying just a shipment of 250,000 AstraZeneca doses have been formally blocked and says the commission has not yet responded to Australia\u2019s request for 1m doses to be made available to hard-hit Papua New Guinea. As Matilda has mentioned on the blog this morning, a European Commission spokesman said at a news conference overnight that the only export request rejected out of nearly 500 received has been a shipment of 250,000 doses to Australia in March. But an Australian government spokesperson said in a statement issued this morning:   As the PM has repeatedly said, we were anticipating AstraZeneca would be able to supply us with 3.8 million doses of their vaccine in the early stages of our rollout from the EU. AZ has not been able to secure an export license from Europe to send the remaining doses, and they know they would never be approved by the European Commission. The EC itself has confirmed their export control regime has blocked the export of a number of those doses, including a shipment of 250,000 doses, and they also requested we withdraw other export permit applications. Of the 3.8 million AZ doses Australia has pre-purchased from overseas supplies \u2013 only 700,000 have been delivered to date, with the government continuing to seek access to 3.1 million manufactured in the EU. The EC is arguing semantics but at the end of the day, all we want is what Australians have ordered so we can get more vaccines in arms. That\u2019s why our sovereign vaccine manufacturing capability has been so crucial to our rollout through CSL. On 17 March, Australia requested 1 million doses of our contracted supply to help support PNG respond to their outbreak. The EU still has not responded to that request. The EC has been absolutely clear in their public and private statements that no further doses of AZ are to be released until they have had their own orders fulfilled. If the EC has changed their approach to standing in the way of Australia\u2019s vaccine deliveries, we welcome it and look forward to receiving our contracted doses, and the 1 million humanitarian doses we want to get to PNG.

The Morrison Government has slammed the European Commission over its denial they didn\u2019t block COVID vaccines to Australia as \u201csemantics\u201d pic.twitter.com/Z1OitG7W37&mdash; Samantha Maiden (@samanthamaiden) April 6, 2021      Updated at 12.19am BST     11.03pm BST       The Dan Tehan press tour continues this morning, moving from ABC TV to ABC radio.  The trade minister was once again asked to explain exactly how many doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been blocked by the EU. His rhetoric has changed slightly from the prime minister\u2019s comments yesterday, suggesting that rather than the EU directly blocking imports, their policies prevent the AstraZeneca company from applying to send vaccines to Australia to begin with:  What we have seen is that the EU has put in export control measures to prevent vaccines from being exported from the European Union to countries, and that has stopped or prevented AstraZeneca, for instance, putting in applications to be able to send the vaccine here to Australia ... They have said that if AstraZeneca put in applications to export to Australia or to other countries that they will be restricted from being able to do this ... Well, we had contracted 3 million doses with AstraZeneca, and if the export controls hadn\u2019t been put in place in Europe. then AstraZeneca would have been able to [meet the contracts].   So it seems as though perhaps it\u2019s a matter of semantics on what exactly \u201cblocking\u201d means.       Updated at 12.21am BST     10.50pm BST       Good morning all, it\u2019s Wednesday, I\u2019m Matilda Boseley, and let\u2019s jump into the day\u2019s news.  You might remember yesterday prime minister Scott Morrison blamed issues with vaccine supplies as the sole reason the federal government has failed to reach its inoculation targets.  Four million Australians were meant to have received vaccines by the end of March but only about 855,000 had received the jab by Monday. Morrison said this was due to 3m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine being blocked from leaving Europe for Australia, \u201cpure and simple\u201d. But it looks as though it isn\u2019t that pure or simple because the EU has come out to deny these claims.  A European Commission spokesperson said at a news conference on Tuesday the only export request rejected out of nearly 500 received was a shipment of 250,000 doses to Australia in March, which was well known:  We cannot confirm any new decision to block vaccine exports to Australia or to any other country.  Another European Commission spokesperson told Reuters that while the bloc had rejected only one of 491 Covid-19 vaccine export requests since it enhanced export transparency in late January, seven requests were now being reviewed \u2013 and therefore shipments were on hold until a decision was made. She declined to say whether a new shipment to Australia was among those being reviewed. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has now just gone on ABC radio and said the EU had made it very clear it wasn\u2019t going to allow vaccine exports before its own contracts had been filled, but it doesn\u2019t appear Australia submitted a formal request for more. Frydenberg mentions only the original application for 250,000 doses that was blocked last month and a request for 1m doses for Papua New Guinea.  Trade minister Dan Tehan has also spoken to the media this morning but was fairly vague on exactly what exports were blocked:  There was an application put in to provide vaccines to Australia and that \u2013 that application was blocked*.  Now, what the EU seems to be saying now is that they will not block any future shipments so we should take that as wonderful news**. That means there\u2019s 1m vaccines hopefully on their way to PNG sooner rather than later and also all the other contracts that we have with AstraZeneca will now be able to be honoured and AstraZeneca will be able to send those to Australia.  *It\u2019s unclear if this is the 250,000 doses blocked or the mysterious 3.1m.  **I\u2019m not convinced this is what they were saying.  In Queensland a well-known Papua New Guinea politician has died of Covid-19 in hospital.

Queensland Health says it not unusual to offer medical support for PNG citizens:  PNG is one of Queensland\u2019s closest neighbours, and when we can offer support to our neighbours, we can, and we will ... Since the beginning of the pandemic, aeromedical crews have transferred a number of Covid-positive, and potentially Covid-positive patients to Queensland.  Smith\u2019s death will not be counted in the official Australian Covid toll as he was diagnosed in PNG.  With that, why don\u2019t we kickstart the day. There is certainly plenty to cover!     Updated at 12.26am BST  ", "Covid-19 vaccines: pressure is on to ensure they go to the most needy, not the highest bidder [2020-04-26T17:30:20Z]": "As the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine intensifies, there\u2019s a question Jane Halton and her team come back to time and again: if and when successful vaccines emerge, what can be done to ensure they don\u2019t simply go to those with the deepest pockets? If market power is allowed to dictate access, how can those most vulnerable to Covid-19 be assured of protection? \u201cWe are acutely aware of this and it is literally a topic that is being discussed on a daily basis,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cBecause to us it is just unacceptable that there is not fair access to a successful vaccine across the world\u2019s population. \u201cThe notion that this would be a question of going to the highest bidder, to us is just totally unacceptable.\u201d Halton, a former secretary of Australia\u2019s health and finance departments, is chair of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations, a global body playing a critical role in financing and coordinating Covid-19 vaccine development.   Related: Coronavirus vaccine: when will we have one?    One of its founding aims is to ensure that vaccines, once developed, are distributed fairly. The world has witnessed what happens when the market is left to dictate vaccine distribution. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, wealthy nations negotiated large advance orders of the vaccine, effectively crowding out poorer countries. The West African ebola crisis \u2013 an outbreak that killed 11,325 people \u2013 exposed its own galling market failure. Even as the death toll in West Africa grew and grew, big pharmaceuticals could not see a way to recoup the considerable losses they would face attempting to find a vaccine. The leader of Britain\u2019s ebola response, Adrian Hill, said there was simply no \u201cbig market\u201d to make it worthwhile for massive corporations. \u201cThere was no business case to make an ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most,\u201d he said. It was out of that failure that the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations emerged. \u201cThe world\u2019s response to this crisis fell tragically short,\u201d it says in explaining its background. \u201cA vaccine that had been under development for more than a decade was not deployed until over a year into the epidemic. \u201cThat vaccine was shown to be 100% effective, suggesting that much of the epidemic could have been prevented. It was evident that we needed a better system to speed the development of vaccines against known epidemic threats.\u201d But Covid-19 presents it with a test like no other. A paper published in the Lancet last month warned of the significant prospect that wealthy countries would monopolise global supply of Covid-19 vaccines. \u201cThis risk is real,\u201d the paper warned. \u201cSuch an outcome would result in a suboptimal allocation of an initially scarce resource.\u201d    There should not be a divide between the haves and the have-nots  WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus     Halton predicts the pressure to secure access to successful vaccines will be \u201castronomical\u201d. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m worried about is vaccine nationalism and I\u2019ve started to use that terminology when I talk to people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been worrying about this issue now for months and months ... What is a mechanism to ensure equitable access?\u201d An estimated minimum of 1 billion people across the globe are vulnerable to Covid-19. They fall into a number of categories: the immunocompromised, those with co-morbidities, the ageing, and frontline medical staff. \u201cSo that says to you you need a lot of vaccine to protect even the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Halton says. It\u2019s a problem the World Health Organisation is also working urgently to solve. This week it announced it planned to design mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution. \u201cWhile we\u2019re looking for vaccines, unless we break the barriers to equitable distribution of the products, whether it\u2019s vaccines or therapeutics, we will have a problem, so we need to address the problem ahead of time,\u201d WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. \u201cThere should not be a divide between the haves and the have-nots.\u201d For private companies, vaccine development is considered risky, protracted and hugely expensive. Companies are faced with the prospect of spending extraordinary amounts to develop vaccines, with a low likelihood of success.   Related: Coronavirus vaccine trials could be done 'by mid-August'    \u201cAs a company, you are not going to spend the hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars that are needed to develop a vaccine,\u201d Halton says. \u201cOne, because you think your chances of being successful are about 5%. [Second], because you don\u2019t even think there\u2019s going to be a market for it. \u201cSo this part of market failure is completely understandable. And that\u2019s why [the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations] was set up.\u201d It believes it needs $US2bn to develop three vaccine candidates in the next 12 to 18 months. It has raised almost half of that. The $2bn does not include the costs of manufacture or delivery. The coalition\u2019s work emphasises speed. Each stage of the vaccine development process is compressed. Halton says the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines are being developed is \u201cunprecedented\u201d. One of the projects the coalition is funding is at the University of Queensland, where researchers are testing a molecular clamp technology they hope can help neutralise the virus. The coalition asked UQ researchers to begin working on a Covid-19 vaccine in January. Within three weeks it had produced the candidate now being tested. \u201cLike every researcher who\u2019s looking at their baby, they are optimistic,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I can say is I hope they\u2019re right. I genuinely hope they\u2019re right. It\u2019s very hard for me to form a judgment about the likelihood of success.\u201d More broadly, she remains optimistic. \u201cI think when we look across all the work that\u2019s going on globally on vaccines, I do have some hope that we will end up with not just one successful candidate \u2013 ideally we would have three,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve said this now publicly several times: hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And if you hope for the best what you would do is hope to get three successful candidates.\u201d", "Australia news live: Victoria and NSW report no new locally acquired cases [2020-11-05T08:07:59Z]": " \n  8.07am GMT  \n What we learned, Thursday 5 November \n  \n  That\u2019s it for tonight, thanks for reading.

To date, 819 people have died from coronavirus in Victoria. \n  This is the sixth straight day where Victoria has recorded zero daily new cases or deaths.  \n  The average number of cases diagnosed in the last 14 days (22 Oct \u2013 4 Nov 2020) for metropolitan Melbourne is 1.4 and regional Victoria is zero. The rolling daily average case number is calculated by averaging out the number of new cases over the past 14 days. \n  The total number of cases from an unknown source in the last 14 days (20 Oct \u2013 2 Nov 2020) is two for metropolitan Melbourne and zero from regional Victoria. The 14-day period for the source of acquisition data ends 48 hours earlier than the 14-day period used to calculate the new case average due to the time required to fully investigate a case and assign its mode of acquisition. \n   Late yesterday, the last remaining active case of COVID-19 linked to an aged care facility outbreak in Victoria was cleared.  \n  \n Updated at 2.47am GMT \n \n \n  2.33am GMT  \n  \n  A new article published by the Global Times, a Chinese state-run media outlet, appears to lend weight to fears that Australian exporters from a range of sectors are facing new trade curbs. \n  To date there has been a muted response in China\u2019s state media to reports earlier in the week of potential disruptions to wine, lobster, sugar, coal, timber, barley and copper from Friday onwards. Officially the Australian government has been relying on denials from China\u2019s commerce ministry but has been seeking to clarify what is going on. \n  The Global Times published an article overnight saying the Australian ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, was set to visit this week\u2019s trade expo in Shanghai \u201cafter China halted seven categories of Australian goods from the market\u201d. \n  This passage is notable because it states the \u201chalt\u201d as fact. However the article does not include any new details about the reported curbs. It later cites Bloomberg News as reporting that China had asked traders to stop purchasing Australian coal, barley, copper ore and concentrate, sugar, timber, wine and lobsters. \n  The Global Times article \u2013 titled Australia nervous at losing China market \u2013 overwhelmingly focuses on how the media reports have \u201csent shockwaves to Australia\u201d. It quotes analysts as warning that \u201cChinese consumers\u2019 confidence in Australian products would significantly drop if Australia continues to sabotage bilateral relations, which would cost Australia its best and biggest market, jobs and an opportunity to quickly recover from the pandemic\u201d. \n  Chen Hong, director of the Australian studies center at East China Normal University in Shanghai, is quoted as warning that \u201cif Australia continues to sabotage bilateral relations, it will pay an unbearable price\u201d. \n  (Earlier this year Australian government cancelled Chen\u2019s Australian visa. Chen told the Guardian in September he \u201cabsolutely refused\u201d to accept intelligence agency Asio\u2019s assessment that he posed a direct or indirect risk to Australia\u2019s security). \n  The latest reports coincide with the third China International Import Expo, in Shanghai, which is meant to showcase China\u2019s trade links. \n  Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, told the opening ceremony on Wednesday his country\u2019s aim was \u201cto turn the China market into a market for the world, a market shared by all, and a market accessible to all\u201d in order to \u201cbring more positive energy to the global community\u201d, the state-owned China Daily reported. \n  \n Updated at 2.48am GMT \n \n \n  2.30am GMT  \n Sydney's Mardi Gras parade cancelled \n  \n  The 2021 Mardi Gras parade in Sydney has been cancelled. \n  Floats will circle the SCG.

So, we look forward to continuing to watch the progress that occurs in the United States. Our democratic values are shared.  \n   It\u2019s important they be upheld. And Labor looks forward to working with the United States. Because the relationship between us is a relationship between our peoples based upon our common democratic values.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.39am GMT \n \n \n  1.34am GMT  \n  \n  OK. Here is Anthony Albanese on \u201ccount every vote\u201d: \n   \n   The alliance between Australia and the United States is our most important.  \n    And we respect the United States because of its democratic values, which we share.  \n   And what we have seen is the largest turnout in the United States for any presidential election since 1908. We need to await the result, clearly.  \n   And we need to be patient, as observers from around the world are, as well as US citizens. Because in a democracy, it\u2019s always based on one vote, one value.  \n   Every person having their vote counted. And it\u2019s absolutely critical that the counts are allowed to continue so that everyone\u2019s view can be tabulated, and it can be determined who the next president of the United States will serve for the next four years. \n   Labor, of course, will work with whoever the American people elect. We also understand that American institutions are so important for our democracy.  \n   Australians will be somewhat concerned, I think, at some of the footage, for example, outside Detroit, Michigan, outside a county, of people shouting in a chant to \u2018stop the count\u2019. That\u2019s really shouting, \u2018Stop democracy\u2019.  \n   And we need, all of us who hold democratic values around the world, need to be prepared to speak up for democracy.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.40am GMT \n \n \n  1.31am GMT  \n  \n  Analysts Ibis World have looked at the implications for Australia if Joe Biden becomes president (as he is projected to do, at this point) \n  China: \n  While economic tension between the United States and China will likely persist over the coming years, a Biden administration is anticipated to confront trade issues with greater predictability and awareness of the indirect effects that trade barriers can have on allies such as Australia. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US-China trade war was one of the biggest factors hampering Australian business confidence. As the effects of the pandemic gradually subside, a return to a predictable globalised trading system, with disputes resolved through multi-lateral organisations such as the World Trade Organisation, will likely inspire confidence in Australian businesses that rely on foreign supply chains. \n  A Biden administration that offers a more constructive relationship with China may also help reset relations between China and Australia. The Sino-Australia trading relationship has become increasingly fraught in recent years, due to a range of issues including Australia\u2019s response to civil upheaval in Hong Kong, Australian restrictions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei, and strengthened national security barriers restricting Chinese investment in Australian businesses. \n  Climate change: \n  Over the last two months, some of Australia\u2019s largest trading partners, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. Under a Biden administration, the United States is anticipated to join these countries. Australia will therefore be conducting over 70% of its two-way trade with nations that have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Australia will almost certainly face greater international pressure to ramp up its climate change policies under a Biden administration. \n  \n \n \n  1.11am GMT  \n  \n  Shares in Treasury Wine Estates fell by as much as 9% in morning trade amid fears Chinese authorities could potentially hit Australian wine exporters with retrospective tariffs. \n  The maker of Penfolds revealed to the market \u2013 after the close of trade yesterday \u2013 that China\u2019s domestic drinks industry was lobbying for back-dated tariffs to be imposed on Australian wine. \n  The share price plunged by 9% this morning, before recovering slightly to be down about 6%. \n  Treasury Wine Estates said the request from China\u2019s domestic industry was associated with the ongoing anti-dumping investigation launched by China\u2019s commerce ministry in August. \n  But the company said it was unclear whether the authorities would end up imposing tariffs and if so whether they would be applied retrospectively \u2013 and therefore the financial impact remains unclear. (The investigation is meant to take up to 12 months.) \n  Treasury Wine Estates also told the market it was aware of speculation about a potential embargo on imports of wine but the company had \u201cnot had any advice or notification from the Chinese authorities in relation to this\u201d. It couldn\u2019t speculate on the potential financial impacts it would face. \n  Meanwhile the Morrison government is still trying to seek certainty about the reports of a range of industries facing potential disruptions at customs from tomorrow (Scott Morrison said this morning he could only take China\u2019s denials at face value but he was concerned). At this stage it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any movement from yesterday\u2019s holding position: \n   \n    Related: Australia calls for China to 'play by the rules' after reports of multibillion-dollar trade bans  \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.19am GMT \n \n \n  1.09am GMT  \n  \n  Presented without comment. \n  (Although this may help explain how he failed to read the DC voter trend over the last few years.) \n   \n   \n    Interview with @BenFordham 2GB - FORDHAM 30 - 051120.mp3\u2014 Joe Hockey (@JoeHockey) November 5, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.15am GMT \n \n \n  12.56am GMT  \n  \n  Details are important: \n   \n   \n    Yes, that's more correctly 3.2 million pairs of nostrils and throats.

What are you ringing me for? \n  Albanese: Because my team lined it up for your team and I do what I\u2019m told. \n  \n Updated at 11.32pm GMT \n \n \n  11.12pm GMT  \n Covid vaccine making starts in Melbourne next week \n  \n  AAP has your vaccine update: \n  Manufacturing of the first coronavirus vaccine for Australians will start in Melbourne next week. \n  Prime minister Scott Morrison revealed the significant step by AstraZeneca and CSL as he announced two more vaccine agreements, taking Australia\u2019s deal total to four. \n  \u201cWith the arrangement with AstraZeneca ... that process begins next week, but the vaccines will be become available over the course of next year, starting in quarter one,\u201d Morrison said. \n  Health department secretary Professor Brendan Murphy said the first doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine would come from overseas. \n  But then there would be a schedule of delivery over the course of 2021 for locally made supplies. \n  CSL signed a heads of agreement with AstraZeneca in September to make 30m doses of the Oxford University-developed vaccine candidate. \n  It also has an agreement with the University of Queensland on another vaccine. \n  Morrison was in Sydney to announce a deal with Novavax to supply 40m vaccine doses and Pfizer-BioNTech for 10m doses. \n  This brings the government\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine investment to more than $3.2bn, adding to deals with UQ-CSL and Oxford-AstraZeneca. \n  Access to the vaccines is subject to clinical trial outcomes on the safety and effectiveness of each candidate, and approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. \n  The Novavax vaccine, made in the United States and the Czech Republic, will require two doses per person, with the first supply expected to arrive in early 2021. \n  The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate is also set to arrive in a similar time frame and will be made in the United States, Belgium and Germany. \n  The Pfizer-BioNTech is a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) type vaccine and the Novovax vaccine is a protein-type vaccine. \n  Health minister Greg Hunt said Australia\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine portfolio now had two protein vaccines and one mRNA and one viral vector type vaccine. \n  \u201cThe goal and the expectation is that Australians who sought vaccination will be vaccinated within 2021,\u201d Hunt said. \n  Health and aged care workers, and the elderly and vulnerable will be the first to gain access to a vaccine. \n  People will be able to initially access the vaccines from GPs, GP respiratory clinics, state and territory vaccination sites and workplaces such as aged care facilities. \n  It will not be mandatory and will be made available free of charge. \n  \n Updated at 11.15pm GMT \n \n \n  11.11pm GMT  \n Joe Hockey claims electoral fraud happened in US election \n  \n  On the \u201cJoe Hockey asserts electoral fraud in the US election claims\u201d I mentioned a little bit ago, Australia\u2019s former ambassador to the US told Sydney radio 2GB: \n   \n   There is plenty of good reason to have litigation,\u201d Hockey said, of Trump\u2019s usual habit of suing when he loses. \n   It is a complete dog\u2019s breakfast, right across, not just Pennsylvania, but right across the country. I mean there are 10,000 different organisations which are responsible for setting the rules for the US presidential election. 10,000. In Australia you have the Australian Electoral Commission, thank God, that governs the rules for federal elections.  \n   In the US, you have every state, and every county and every city. And if there is a strong bias, one way or the other, they do everything they can to suppress the vote, or increase the vote. It\u2019s a mess. \n   \n  Asked if there is a chance electoral fraud has happened, Hockey says: \n   \n   Oh, for sure. The question is whether it is enough to change the election outcome and I doubt it is, but absolutely. In some states they sent out ballot papers to every household. \n   In Washington DC, they sent out ballot papers to every household and some people got two ballot papers ... and of course, last night, in Washington DC, 93% of the city voted for Joe Biden. 93%. \n   Even my best booth ... when the Kidmans were handing out for the Labor party, even my best booth, I got 83%. 93% in the city. I find it hard to believe.  \n   So you know, there is a lot of areas where it is very messy.\u201d \n   \n  Hockey isn\u2019t asked to explain his assertion. \n  (Adding this in here) \n   \n   \n    Joe Hockey (Australia's former Ambassador to the US) claimed this morning that electoral fraud had \"for sure\" occurred. He pointed to the fact DC voted 93% for Biden, \"I find it hard to believe\".Recent DC results for Dems:2016: 91%2012: 91%2008: 92%\u2014 Osman Faruqi (@oz_f) November 4, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.04am GMT \n \n \n  10.54pm GMT  \n  \n  So a whole lot of \u201cwait and watch\u201d nothing there. \n  \n Updated at 10.58pm GMT \n \n \n  10.54pm GMT  \n  \n  Yeah, but the world is stressing. Plus there are implications for Australia with trade and potentially China, as well as on climate and ... \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   First of all, I don\u2019t share the impatience of others when it comes to a result being arrived at.  \n   By that, I mean the speculation in the media and the commentary around that.  \n   I think it\u2019s important to simply just be patient.  \n   And there\u2019ll be a result and we\u2019ll soon know what that is and then we\u2019ll be able to provide the appropriate recognition of that and get on with what is an amazing and wonderful and very important relationship with Australia.  \n   \n  And on Australia\u2019s ongoing trade issues with China \u2013 particularly that wine is under threat? \n   \n   On the other matter you have raised, I simply note that that is not what China has said they\u2019re doing.  \n   I mean, China has denied that is what they\u2019re doing and I can only can take that at face value out of the respect of the comprehensive strategic partnership we have with China and to work through the channels that we have under that relationship to address the issues that have arisen.  \n   Now, those issues are matters that the trade minister and I, obviously, have concerns about and are working closely with industry to pursue the appropriate channels within the relationship to seek \u2013 to get some clarity and some resolution of those.  \n   But I simply note that what you have suggested is something that China has denied and so that \u2013 you know, I can only refer you to what they have said they\u2019re not doing and on that basis, I will take that add face value and we\u2019ll continue to work through the process. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.59pm GMT \n \n \n  10.51pm GMT  \n  \n  Would it be potentially damaging to the relationship, if there are protracted court battles over the result of the US election? \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   What is always damaging is speculating. And so I don\u2019t propose to do that. Media can, you can, that\u2019s fine.  \n   But governments don\u2019t speculate. We have relationships and we act with respect to our partner countries, particularly allies. United States is a great country.  \n   There are great people and they\u2019re making a decision about what should leave them and we have that same opportunity here in Australia.  \n   I mean, this is \u2013 this is a democracy that has withstood the demands of centuries and I had have no doubt it will continue to prevail and continue to be a great and \u2013 a great partner for Australia.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.15am GMT \n \n \n  10.49pm GMT  \n  \n  What about Joe Hockey\u2019s claims that there could be fraud in this election? And Dave Sharma\u2019s (much more sensible) views that democracy needs to be respected? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I expressed my own views and I have just expressed them.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.48pm GMT  \n Scott Morrison 'won't run commentary' on US election \n  \n  Scott Morrison uses a lot of words to say he won\u2019t comment on the US election. \n  Q: Prime minister, how worried about you one of the greatest democracies in the world given that the US president has effectively dismissed the counting in the election?  \n  Morrison: Well, the great thing about the United States, it is a great democracy and it does have great institutions and we have a deep and wide relationship with the United States which is incredibly important to Australia.  \n  We are both like-minded and like in so many ways. Our values, our partnerships, economics, security and in so many ways. And I have great confidence in the democracy of the United States and I have great confidence in their institutions and the thing about great institutions and democracies is they deal with whatever challenges come, just like our own does.  \n  That\u2019s why I expect confidence. I think, you know, a great democracy, having a great election with the greatest turnout it\u2019s ever seen in its history is actually a demonstration of democracy working.  \n  Q: Do you think that Donald Trump is trying to undermine democracy given his claims of electoral fraud and his move to stop counting?  \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I\u2019m not a participant in the US political process. I\u2019m a partner. Australia is a partner with the United States and we respect the decisions that the American people make in their democracy. And we\u2019ll be patient and we\u2019ll await the outcome of their process.  \n   It\u2019s not for me to run a commentary on those things and I won\u2019t.  \n   I work with the president of the United States as the prime minister of Australia and I enjoy a very productive working relationship with the president and I will always put Australian\u2019s interest first in that relationship.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.14am GMT \n \n \n  10.41pm GMT  \n  \n  Professor Brendan Murphy speaks on what some of those potential vaccines look like: \n   \n   So I\u2019m here today as chair of the government scientific and technical advisory group on vaccines and this is a high-powered group that gets together regularly to look at the now quite extensive array of potential vaccines around the world and advise the Australian government on purchases.  \n   We have now got four vaccines that we have secured plus our partnership in the Covax facility, the international buying potential to provide another vaccine if that comes up in the future, but these four vaccines give us over 134 million doses of vaccines and it\u2019s a diversified array of vaccines.  \n   We now have two what we call protein sub-unit vaccines, the University of Queensland CSL vaccine, and now the Novavax vaccine.  \n   Protein vaccines are the most established technology and so it\u2019s good to have two of those to make sure that we can \u2013 we have a choice depending on the results of the phase 3 clinical trials of how we use them.  \n   We\u2019re also, as you know, have the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine which is [non-replicating viral vector vaccine] which is looking increasingly promising as its trials progress. \n    And now, of course, we now have the access to the Pfizer mRNA vaccine.  \n   This is a very exciting new technology. MRNA vaccines have not previously been registered for human use and we now have this as well. It is a diversified strategy.  \n   As the prime minister has said, we still have to wait for phase 3 clinical trials, we still have to see which vaccine works better in which population and how effectively, but we have not put all our eggs in the one basket.  \n   We have diversified our strategy and we have the capacity now to start vaccinating the Australian population in the first quarter of next year which is a terrific outcome and gives us a very, very strong position internationally in access to vaccines. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.12am GMT \n \n \n  10.34pm GMT  \n  \n  Scott Morrison is speaking on the latest vaccine agreement. \n  The game hasn\u2019t changed there - we have an agreement for access to a few vaccines, when they are actually created, tested and produced. \n  He knows everyone is just waiting for his views on Trump and asks that they go through the announcement, which includes head of health, Professor Brendan Murphy, before getting to questions. \n  \n \n \n  10.24pm GMT  \n Adani changes its name to 'Bravus' in Australia \n  \n  Mining company Adani has rebranded it\u2019s Australian operations \u201cBravus\u201d. \n  Dr Nikola Casule, head of research and investigations at Greenpeace Australia Pacific isn\u2019t impressed: \n   \n   The Latin for \u2018brave\u2019 isn\u2019t \u2018bravus\u2019.  \n   The word Adani is looking for is \u2018fortis\u2019, which English \u2018fortitude\u2019 is derived from.  \n   \u2018Bravus\u2019 is a \u2018vulgar\u2019 (medieval) Latin version based on the Latin \u2018barbarus\u2019, meaning barbarian. \n   Bravus was eventually adopted as an English word, via Middle French to become our word \u2018brave\u2019, but the word itself had much of a connotation of a violent enemy of civilisation. \n   A word with its roots in \u201cbarbarian\u201d is fitting for a company whose proposed Carmichael mega mine would accelerate the global warming crisis that threatens our own, human civilisation\u2019s life on planet earth.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.34pm GMT \n \n \n  10.21pm GMT  \n  \n  We are just waiting to hear from Scott Morrison. \n  Obviously, given Donald Trump\u2019s false claims, attempts to claim victory when not all votes have been counted, and now, claiming states he has not won (Twitter is having a very busy time of it, keeping up with his tweets and adding warnings/taking down those which are just lies), Morrison will be asked about the election. \n  The line from the government, as issued by Marise Payne this morning, and one which Labor (and some government backbenchers \u2013 as well as Malcolm Turnbull said yesterday) is that all votes need to be counted. \n  That\u2019s a repudiation of Trump\u2019s message. \n   \n    Related: Australian politicians rebuke Trump stating US voters 'deserve to have their voices heard'  \n   \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.31pm GMT \n \n \n  10.03pm GMT  \n  \n  Again, it\u2019s not even officially storm season. \n   \n   \n    #QLDstorms update: Insurers are reporting more than 22,500 claims, with losses estimated at $260 million - up from $240 million yesterday. #bnestorms #hailstorms #brisbanestorms #insurance #hailstorms #Ipswich #GoldCoast #SEQld\u2014 Insurance Council (@ICAUS) November 4, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.05pm GMT \n \n \n  9.51pm GMT  \n  \n  Greg Hunt\u2019s vaccine announcement comes down to this: \n   \n    We now have what are called two protein vaccines, one viral vector and one mRNA.  \n   135 million units of vaccine are potentially available for Australia, with the most likely timing being the first quarter, probably March, for the first vaccines to roll out.  \n    It\u2019s all dependent on the clinical trials and the regulatory approvals.  \n    But every day I\u2019m becoming cautiously but progressively more hopeful about access for all Australians throughout the course of 2021 to vaccines. \n   \n  That was him speaking to the Seven network. \n  \n Updated at 10.03pm GMT \n \n \n  9.38pm GMT  \n  \n  Victoria is also keeping its testing rates up, which is great news. \n   \n   \n    13,479 tests today.

He\u2019s continuing on in as the national secretary of the manufacturing arm, but the split in one of the nation\u2019s most powerful unions is evident. And the move could see John Setka\u2019s power in the union increase, which will be a massive headache for Anthony Albanese \u2013 the Labor leader forced Setka out of the Labor party after Setka pleaded guilty to harassing his wife, Emma Walters. Walters and Setka had reconciled before the case went to court. \n  O\u2019Connor has issued a statement this morning. This is part of it: \n   \n   I have tendered my resignation as National Secretary to the CFMMEU National Executive and will continue as National Secretary of the Manufacturing Division. \n   I am proud of the work our union has done over the past ten years.  \n   We have been a powerful voice for working people in some of the toughest industries in this country. \n   We have defended the rights of our members, protected and expanded their entitlements, delivered them better pay and a fairer share of the proceeds of their hard work. \n   Whatever is said about the recent history of the CFMMEU, that is the test that really matters for a union and its leadership. \n   These achievements have only been possible because we have been a united, cohesive union, working together toward shared goals. \n   Sadly, what has been an effective organisation, united in purpose is now totally dysfunctional. \n   The organisation has now failed the test of political maturity with people unwilling to work together, listen to each other or compromise for the sake of the organisation and its members. \n   We have held this organisation together through some tough times, but unfortunately the differences are irreconcilable. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.02pm GMT \n \n \n  9.21pm GMT  \n  \n  CNN has called Michigan for Joe Biden.

I try.  \n   I\u2019m someone who works with everybody. I like to bring people together. But when the other person or people are very, kind of, set in their ways*, it\u2019s very difficult to change their course.  \n   \n   \n   But I hope the announcement we made yesterday encourages both the WA premier and the Queensland premier to follow suit because the devastating impacts of job losses in March, April, May next year, I worry about the June quarter next year unless we take action now.  \n   Unless we accept that the buck stops with us as Australians. Yes, we\u2019re all residents of a state but we have a national economy which we all have to support.  \n   If we don\u2019t, the consequences for our citizens will be devastating, not just here in New South Wales but across everywhere.  \n   We\u2019re doing well in New South Wales but we need to rely on other states to buy our product, to improve our gross state product and to keep our economy going. Other states rely on us for GST revenue. If our citizens don\u2019t consume, they don\u2019t get GST revenue. We\u2019re all connected. And this is really the message I\u2019m trying to get across to our colleagues.  \n   \n  *Your millionth reminder that in Queensland, under the Public Health Act, it is the chief health officer who makes these decisions.

How many cases would there need to be? \n  It depends on Victoria\u2019s capacity to get on top of the outbreaks, because that\u2019s the real test. The answer was \u201ca lot\u201d. \n  Berejiklian: \n   \n   You might have a certain number of cases in one area, but they\u2019re all household contacts and know where they\u2019re coming from.  \n   But when there are unknown sources that\u2019s problematic.  \n   I promised myself after Easter I would do everything I could never to make the decision to have my state go into lockdown again and we have been able to sustain that.  \n   As difficult as it\u2019s been, New South Wales has stayed resilient, open, robust and certainly a that\u2019s what I said to myself in relation to borders \u2013 I don\u2019t want to see any state in Australia to put up borders. I think we learnt enough with dealing with the virus and the consequences to take proactive steps so we can prevent that type of activity into the future and that\u2019s certainly what I do, what we try to do in New South Wales, is learn from every new development, take that forward and protect our citizens but also protect their jobs, their livelihoods, their economies, we\u2019ve got no international students, no initial travellers, markets are disrupted.  \n   We have to rely in each other in Australia to the short and medium term, but you can\u2019t when some state premiers are being so stubborn. \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.05pm GMT \n \n \n  8.59pm GMT  \n  \n  I wonder if Gladys Berejiklian dreams of borders in her sleep? \n  Here she was chatting to ABC News Breakfast this morning: \n   \n   The best advice I have from our health experts is that pretty much because of the very harsh severe and prolonged lockdown down there, that the virus at this point in time is pretty much eliminated from Victoria.  \n   What we\u2019re doing is waiting until the 23rd because on the 9th premier Andrews will allow Melburnians to travel throughout Victoria and then we start allowing Victorians in two weeks after that.  \n   We think that\u2019s adequate time. The health experts certainly believe that was the case and I wouldn\u2019t have made the decision if they hadn\u2019t supported me in that.  \n   I\u2019m very comfortable with the decision we have taken but any decision like that comes with a risk.  \n   When you\u2019re dealing with a pandemic and weigh up the economic factors and the health risk, you have to ride that steady cause of a steady balance and I think that\u2019s what New South Wales has.  \n   I hope my announcement yesterday put as bit of pressure on Queensland and WA to do the right thing. I think the biggest challenge we\u2019ll face in the new year is, yes, keeping on top of the virus but also looking down potentially hundreds of thousands of job losses once jobkeeper finishes in March. \n    I don\u2019t want to see a situation where too many households are worrying about their future, their income, their livelihoods. I want to be in a position where we enhance the quality of life of our citizens and that\u2019s why we took the decision we did yesterday.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.04pm GMT \n \n \n  8.44pm GMT  \n Good morning \n  \n  If you managed any sleep last night, congratulations. I take my hat off to you. I did not, as I pinballed between nihilistic hope and existential despair. \n  This morning has not cleared anything up. Joe Biden has won Wisconsin but Donald Trump\u2019s camp wants a recount and for counting to be halted in Michigan, where Biden has a slight lead. \n  But it looks as though Republicans have maintained control of the Senate, despite a record spend on campaigning by the Democrats. \n  The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, told the ABC this morning there was \u201cno question this is a difficult moment\u201d for the US, as it deals with Trump\u2019s false and baseless claims the election is being \u2018stolen\u2019. \n  \u201cWhat is important is that every vote is counted, and I\u2019m sure they will be,\u201d she said, in what is a pretty strong statement given that the US is one of Australia\u2019s closest allies, and not one Australia is known to ever speak back to. \n  It\u2019s going to be another long day. \n  Back home, Greg Hunt is trying to get people to care about the latest vaccine deals Australia has struck \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to get too many bites out of that cherry. There is no vaccine as yet, though there are some promising trials. Australia has a finger in a few pies, but an actual vaccine is still some time away. \n   \n   \n    Two more COVID-19 vaccines have been secured bringing our Government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine investment to more than $3.2bn.

CEOs of all major metropolitan and regional hospitals, and aged care provider peak bodies, have been contacted and briefed to ensure they have the support they need. \n  Meanwhile, the report says the Commission for Aged Care Quality and Safety has worked directly with the response centre and has completed 100 spot-checks on facilities around Victoria, and Western Health has assisted with prevention measures at 33 facilities.  \n  More than 20,000 shifts have been filled by a commonwealth-funded surge workforce to assist aged care facility managers, the report says. \n  \n Updated at 8.16am BST \n \n \n  7.53am BST  \n Barnaby Joyce defends aged care minister keeping his job \n  \n  Barnaby Joyce has defended the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, keeping his ministerial job after pressure from the opposition he should be stripped of the portfolio over his performance during the pandemic.  \n  Previously, Colbeck has been unable to state how many deaths have occurred in aged care since the outbreak of Covid-19.  \n  Joyce told Patricia Karvelas: \n   \n   I think it\u2019s kind of ridiculous to go to a person in parliament and say because they didn\u2019t get a number right therefore they\u2019ve absconded from all responsibilities and all care about aged care. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d \n   \n  On the government\u2019s handling of aged care during the pandemic: \n   \n   It is not normal times. It is not something that can be predicted like you predict spring coming. It just didn\u2019t work like that. And obviously everybody had to learn as they went along. If we had our chance again, if we knew what we knew now, all of us would do a better job. You show me any political party of any colour that had the script written for a pandemic. \n   \n  Joyce also rejected the idea of restructuring Australia\u2019s aged care system away from for-profit providers, after research conducted for the aged care royal commission showed smaller and state-run facilities had significantly better care outcomes than for-profit homes. \n   \n   How are you going to provide for these services in the future with this mountain of debt? Who is going to pay the debt back? We\u2019re just going to keep borrowing money over and over again? Of course you\u2019ll need the private sector involved. Because in the future we won\u2019t have the money to just spend on anything we wish as much as we wish to. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.22am BST \n \n \n  7.34am BST  \n  \n  There are a few more hours left in this day and Elias Visontay will take you through them. \n  I\u2019m off tomorrow, after working the weekend, but the wonderful Calla Wahlquist will be stepping in as your day blogger, so you are more than covered.  \n  I\u2019ll be back early on Monday morning when the parliament resumes sitting.

I\u2019m so glad we can almost cross another week of this lockdown off for Melbourne \u2013 I do think about how it would feel to be reading this stuff while you\u2019re under such heavy restrictions and I\u2019m sorry for some of the faffing you\u2019re subject to.

Ax \n  \n Updated at 7.45am BST \n \n \n  7.29am BST  \n  \n  Patricia Karvelas asked Tony Burke what he thought about the government\u2019s proposed foreign agreement veto. \n  Burke: \n   \n   The relationship with other countries, the first principle is the relationship with other countries is principally the job of the Australian government. \n   \n  PK: It is a federal issue? Should they be able to override [the states] based on that principle? \n  Burke:  \n   \n   You want high level, I\u2019m giving you high level. The relationship with other countries is principally the responsibility of the federal government.  \n   How they deal with states is where there should be direct discussions with the states. Even the prime minister won\u2019t answer the question that you\u2019ve just put. And he has seen something closer to the legislation than what I\u2019ve seen.  \n   Even the prime minister was asked exactly what you\u2019ve just put to me. And he wasn\u2019t going further than I\u2019ve gone. Given having not seen the legislation and he\u2019s the one developing it, I reckon I have probably given a reasonable answer. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.33am BST \n \n \n  7.19am BST  \n  \n  The Senate delegated legislation scrutiny committee has delivered its latest report \u2013 giving a serve to the government for the way it\u2019s handled some Covid-19 crisis measures. \n  The committee, chaired by the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, took aim at the social services minister, Anne Ruston, for extending the cashless debit card trials to 31 December by ministerial determination rather than legislation. \n  It said: \n   \n   From a scrutiny perspective, the committee strongly considers that it is necessary and appropriate for the parliament to be provided with an opportunity to consider and scrutinise the extension of the end dates for these measures at the earliest available opportunity, rather than leaving this significant matter to be determined in delegated legislation for an extended period of time. \n   \n  The committee called for a bill formally extending the program to be brought on for vote next week, or it will move to disallow the determination. \n  Then the committee got in a scrap with the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, about tougher foreign takeover rules \u2013 and the fact they don\u2019t have a \u201cspecified end date\u201d, which would be appropriate \u201cfrom a scrutiny perspective\u201d. But Frydenberg refused to nominate a date \u2013 twice. \n  It said: \n   \n   Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Senate disallow the instrument and has therefore resolved to give a notice of motion to disallow the instrument on 1 September 2020 for consideration and debate in the Senate 15 sitting days after that date. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.22am BST \n \n \n  7.13am BST  \n  \n  The push is well and truly on in Victoria for Daniel Andrews to release the stage three plan for Melbourne: \n   \n   \n    ...and our combined efforts to support businesses and their workers are urgently needed.

Laundry, cleaning, suspected identification of Covid, supporting older Australians.  \n   ... That is part of what we set up with our surge workforce preparation announced on the 11 March.  \n   It\u2019s part of what we built on the 13 March with a national public hospital agreement where we agreed to provide 50% of the funding incurred by state hospitals in relation to their Covid-19 preparation. And it\u2019s related to what we also did with our work on the 31 March where we announced in particular the private hospitals agreement, an agreement that has seen 452 patients, on the advice that I have, transferred to those private hospitals. And in addition to that supported by the national testing contract, which allows for every resident and every staff member to be tested.  \n   As well as I mentioned, 69 million masks as well as gloves and gowns and goggles also distributed across the country, and in aged care 14 million.  \n   All of these things in context occur in a world where we have a pandemic where 24 million people were infected as of today. By the time we come back on Monday, it\u2019s likely that will have increased to 25 million people.  \n   It\u2019s likely, as a consequence, 24-25,000 lives will be lost. Around the world, we have a global pandemic. In Australia, what we have managed to do in seven out of eight states and territories is to keep that pandemic at bay. In Victoria, where there was a mass community outbreak, which has seen 95% of the case growth, we managed to fight so much of that.

On every occasion, when I have spoken on these matters, whether it\u2019s the very specific cases and the individual deaths of Australians that have been impacted or particularly those four facilities in Victoria, when members opposite have asked me about those matters, I have addressed each of those issues.  \n   On 75 occasions, 75 questions, we\u2019ve been responding, specifically, to the issues that have been presented.  \n   What I have also done, when being questioned about the preparedness and when questioned about the plan, I think it\u2019s important that Australians also know that the actions that have been taken by the government, working with other governments, has also been able to prevent what has occurred in some places has not occurred in many, many other places in Australia.  \n   What we\u2019ve been able to do is reassure Australians, particularly those who have families in residential aged care, those in residential aged care themselves, that while the community outbreak that we\u2019ve seen in Victoria has got into the aged care system and we\u2019ve sought to respond to that, Mr Speaker, and we\u2019ve been able to contain as much possible, as much we\u2019ve been able, that impact, Mr Speaker, the impact in Australia when you look at how Covid is presented in our aged care system, there\u2019s been 8% of facilities who had resident infections, but when you look overseas, similar countries, 56% of facilities have had resident and staff infections in the United Kingdom.  \n   So Australia\u2019s actions have made a difference, I would say, Mr Speaker. I think it\u2019s important to give people hope about these things.  \n   But on every occasion, we have shown absolute respect, Mr Speaker, and absolute understanding and sympathy to the impacts on those families.  \n   For the leader of the opposition to suggest otherwise, I think, I would hope very unlike him. I hope it is very unlike him.  \n   Because it\u2019s I think a very unreasonable thing to have presented in this place. I hope he wouldn\u2019t stoop to that level again. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.15am BST \n \n \n  6.08am BST  \n  \n  Cool beans \n   \n   \n    Emergency Management Minister @D_LittleproudMP says he and the PM have been briefed by leading agencies that there\u2019s \u201ca 70% chance of a severe La Ni\u00f1a event forming\u201d - that means - \u201cmore severe cyclones, more frequent cyclones, and will also mean greater flooding\u201d #7News #auspol pic.twitter.com/sJaI9FVKYo\u2014 Jennifer Bechwati (@jenbechwati) August 27, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.07am BST  \n  \n  That answer includes the first strong support of Michael Sukkar from Scott Morrison since the Age and 60 Minutes story on the Victorian Liberal branch stacking broke on Sunday night. \n  Before that, he has either not commented (through his office) while yesterday, when asked at his first press conference of the week, he said Australians would not want him to be distracted by those issues. \n  \n Updated at 6.11am BST \n \n \n  6.04am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Today in the Senate, the minister for aged care, Senator Colbeck, turned his back and fled the chamber in order to avoid debate on his performance. Not a single member of the government defended the minister. Can it really be the case there\u2019s no one on the government backbench who could do a better job than Senator Colbeck? \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I\u2019m very concerned of one thing, there\u2019s no one who sits over there who could [be a better aged care minister], than any of the people who sit on this side. Not just on that issue, Mr Speaker. \n   Not on the issue of aged care, but certainly when it comes to our fine treasurer, Mr Speaker. You won\u2019t find a treasurer on that side, you won\u2019t find another deputy prime minister as good as this one, who is pretending to do it on that side, or the minister for home affairs, or attorney general, Mr Speaker. \n   Or a minister for energy, Mr Speaker. I know the member for Hunter would like to join our policy on energy. I know, Mr Speaker, when we\u2019re asked about things like gas, you get our responses, I know the member for Hunter would like to join us in adding to the answer. \n   You won\u2019t find a minister for health ... \n   \n  Tony Burke interrupts with a point of order: \n   \n   Given the gravity of the issue we\u2019re dealing with today ... there is a question over a minister for aged care, you think the prime minister could spend more than three seconds talking about the minister for aged care. \n   \n  Tony Smith:  \n   \n   Just ruling on the point of order ... I just say to the manager of opposition business, if the question wasn\u2019t littered with political comment and the sort of language it had in it, he would have a much stronger case. I made the point before, I make it very clear when questions have such a strong element of debate, political comment and the language used about the minister for aged care in the Senate chamber, my attitude, so there\u2019s no confusion, it opens it up for whoever is answering. The prime minister has the call. \n   \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Outstanding ministers here. The minister for agriculture, and the minister for emergency management, you won\u2019t find one like that, Mr Speaker.  \n   And of course the minister for Indigenous Australians, who I know in his great humility, in his great humility, who worked closely with the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, but you won\u2019t find a finer minister for Indigenous Australians.  \n   The minister for communications, Mr Speaker.  \n   The minister for education, for industry, for environment, for national disabilities, and of course, the assistant treasurer, Mr Speaker [Michael Sukkar], whose pioneering work on the homebuilder scheme, the home lender scheme, is getting Australians into their first home. \n   Those opposite mock, Mr Speaker. \n   But what my government is doing is keeping Australians safe, it\u2019s keeping Australians strong, and it\u2019s keeping Australians together. These mob on that side, Mr Speaker, can\u2019t keep themselves together. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.10am BST \n \n \n  5.57am BST  \n  \n  Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: \n  Why did the prime minister wait until 3 August to announce a paid pandemic leave payment in Victoria, after more than 100 aged care residents had died? Does he agree with the South Australian Liberal treasurer it makes no sense for the prime minister to fund a scheme in Tasmania, with one active case, but not South Australia, with three, and why won\u2019t the prime minister make sure that paid pandemic leave is available for all Australians? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I have written to all premiers and chief ministers, they have all been offered the same set of arrangements that are provided to Victoria.  \n   The Tasmanian government has taken up that offer. I have written back to the premiers of New South Wales and Queensland today, and Western Australia, Mr Speaker, they have sought further information on these arrangements and we are providing that information.  \n   I\u2019m yet to \u2013 I have not yet seen a request from South Australia. Should they make that request, Mr Speaker, then we\u2019ll respond to that request as well.  \n   We have enabled this disaster payment to be made available for those who need to isolate in relation to the pandemic and that was done following a very good agreement that I was able to reach with the Victorian premier, and I\u2019m pleased we can extend that to the other states and territories. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.04am BST \n \n \n  5.53am BST  \n  \n  Anika Wells to Scott Morrison: \n  On 12 August, the royal commission heard some aged care workers in Victoria still [didn\u2019t] get masks, gloves, or gowns. Why? \n  Greg Hunt gets this one: \n  I have largely answered this. I may add to that. In relation to ... [there are interjections] \n  ... As I said, more generally across the country, 14 million masks have been provided to aged care facilities. In relation to gowns, 3 million gowns have been provided, 7.66 million pairs of gloves. In relation, and specifically to P2 respirators, 1.3 million, and over yesterday, more than, we had really 50,000 masks provided within Victoria.  \n  So there\u2019s an ongoing and continuous supply made available, I am aware, I am aware that in some facilities they may have had distribution challenges. What we do, whether it\u2019s through Ausmat, the work of the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre ... \n  Tony Smith: \n  It may assist the House if the leader of the opposition and the minister for home affairs cease their very loud conversation. \n  ... Yeah, it was cordial. But it\u2019s still disruptive. OK. \n  Either Dutton or Albanese (I can\u2019t hear which one) \n   \n   We\u2019re united. \n   \n  Smith: \n  Are you? OK. There\u2019s a great anteroom out there. Do you want to go? The minister has the call. \n  Hunt: \n   \n   Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. And in addition to that, what we do is, through Ausmat, the ADF, through the work of the aged care quality and safety commissioner and the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, engage with every facility that has need, and we work with the national medical stockpile to ensure those distributions are made. The other area, there\u2019s been 3 million 167,245 goggles or face shields distributed to aged care in Victoria. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.58am BST \n \n \n  5.46am BST  \n  \n  (Sidenote. That was Alicia Payne\u2019s last question in QT ahead of having her baby - she is on maternity leave from early next week.) \n  \n Updated at 5.52am BST \n \n \n  5.46am BST  \n  \n  Alicia Payne to Scott Morrison: \n  The royal commission heard evidence that aged care workers could only use two masks or one glove per shift. How can residents and staff be protected from the deadly Covid virus when staff can only use one glove per shift? \n  Greg Hunt gets this one as well. I think Scott Morrison has only taken one of these questions this question time - he is sending them all to Hunt, which appears to be the new strategy after yesterday. \n  Hunt: \n   \n    I want to address this question and correct some of the claims made. In relation to infection control and in relation to PPE, what we have seen across the country is at a time when there was a global shortage of supply and a global spike in demand, Australia has been one of the countries that has been able to not only maintain but to dramatically expand our flow. We\u2019ve had over 400 million masks enter the national medical stock pile.  \n   We\u2019ve been able to secure masks until the end of the year, to secure gloves and gowns. More than 69 million masks have been dispatched from the national medical stockpile. That includes 14 million to aged care facilities around the country.  \n   What that also includes, in particular, 10 million masks dispatched for Victorian aged care workers. It includes gloves and gowns and other items, such as hand sanitiser, all of these elements have been fundamental, fundamental to ensuring continuity of care.  \n   The national medical stockpile, if it receives a request, will process it as a matter of urgency in relation to a facility.  \n   On multiple occasions, we issued new rounds of support and only yesterday I noticed there were some tens of thousands of masks made available to Victorian providers.  \n   The correct answer is that gloves, gowns, masks, hand sanitiser, have all been made available through the national medical stockpile. Historically it was only responsible amongst those things for the masks.  \n   We made sure on our watch, in our time, gowns and gloves and sanitiser was added to the stockpile. It was over and above what was agreed with the states, as opposed to the responsibility of the commonwealth, on our watch, on our responsibility, under the guidance of the prime minister, we took those decisions to act.  \n   All of those elements have been provided. But as of coming here today, shortly before joining you, the national incident centre has advised me of 69 million masks, of which 14 million were provided to aged care, and over 10 million to Victoria. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.51am BST \n \n \n  5.44am BST  \n  \n  Peter Dutton takes a dixer on cyber-security, and answers it without a single political attack. \n  Just substance. \n  It\u2019s a refreshing and welcome change (the expansion of ASD\u2019s and the surveillance powers in general is another issue - I\u2019m only talking about the attitude). \n  Dutton: \n   \n   We want to make sure that a cyber-attack on our banking sector didn\u2019t result in banks unable to settle transactions at the end of the day, or people not being able to go into a local cafe or restaurant or small business to pay by way of tap and go, it would be crippling. We\u2019ve seen cyber-attacks here at a record level in recent months.  \n   And during the period of this pandemic, we know that many crime groups are targeting young children online.  \n   We know that paedophile groups are targeting and trying to groom young children online, it is what makes it necessary we defeat that scourge through the cyber-security strategy.  \n   I want to say thank you to the prime minister and the heads of our agencies, working day and night on this strategy to make sure we can keep Australians safe, and we\u2019ll continue to work with industry, with every sector, to make sure that environment online is as safe as it can be. \n   \n  Anthony Albanese associates Labor with the remarks: \n   \n   It\u2019s quite frankly just abhorrent and hard to understand this scourge. This evil. And we need to do whatever we can to wipe it out. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.47am BST \n \n \n  5.33am BST  \n  \n  Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: \n  It\u2019s well known that many aged care workers are employed on a casual basis and work across multiple facilities. Given aged care workers moving between different facilities is a key driver of infection, why did the prime minister wait until 19 July, when the virus was widespread, to announce the Victorian aged care workers could work at a single facility, that initiative? \n  Greg Hunt gets this one as well: \n   \n   In responding to the Victorian outbreak, an issue which we know has seen over 17,000 cases, in that state, and those have had an impact indeed, in relation to all elements of society, whether it\u2019s hospitals, whether it\u2019s aged care, we\u2019ve been particularly focused on aged care.  \n   This has been a daily focus and what we have done is follow the medical advice in relation to actions taken.  \n   That\u2019s been the abiding principle of what we\u2019ve done as a government, follow the medical advice, worked with the AHPPC or the medical expert panel under the leadership of Professor Brendan Murphy and now under the leadership of Professor Paul Kelly.  \n   Those reasons together are why as a country where there\u2019s no aged care facility outbreaks around the rest of the country, in 7 out of 8 states and territories, but there are in Victoria.  \n   They have followed community transmission and there was reference earlier to a paper that the Victorian government provided on infection control, and what that showed is that overwhelmingly it was the case of community transmission which led to the passage through staff who were asymptomatic into aged care facilities.  \n   As a part of that, we took the decisions that we made based on the medical advice provided by the medical experts. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.39am BST \n \n \n  5.30am BST  \n  \n  Josh Frydenberg uses the end of his dixer answer to again attack Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   You get the virus under control, restrictions start to ease, and customers and jobs come back, Mr Speaker. And nowhere is this message more important than in my home state of Victoria.  \n   The message of hope is needed.  \n   That\u2019s why Victorians were so aghast when the Victorian government said there was a prospect of the state of emergency continuing for another 12 months, Mr Speaker.  \n   Victorians need to hear more about the road out than along the road in, Mr Speaker.  \n   That\u2019s why the Morrison government stands with Victorians and indeed 25 million Australians to support Australians get to the other side of Covid-19. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.36am BST \n \n \n  5.25am BST  \n  \n  Over in the Senate, Pauline Hanson, who is attending parliament virtually this sitting, forgot to unmute her microphone to ask her question. \n  It took her a bit, but she got there.  \n  \n \n \n  5.24am BST  \n  \n  Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: \n  Under the prime minister\u2019s own emergency response document for Covid-19, his government is responsible for aged care infection control guidelines. Victoria\u2019s chief medical officer has revealed that poor infection practice is the main driver.  \n  Today, more than 360 families are grieving as a result. Does the prime minister accept his failure to act has led to the deaths of vulnerable aged care residents? \n  Greg Hunt gets this one: \n   \n   Thank you very much, and I think it\u2019s important to address the documents in question. There\u2019s two principle documents that refer to the national and state responsibilities with regards to the national pandemic health plan and with regards to the national Covid-19 aged care plan.  \n   In relation to the pandemic health plan, which was released on 18th February, and activated by the prime minister on 27 February, I turn to section 4.1.4, implementation of public health measures.  \n   Very specifically, the Australian government will be responsible for residential aged care facilities, working with other healthcare providers to set standards to promote the safety and securities of people in aged care.  \n   State and territory governments \u2013 and this was a document worked on and agreed by the states, state and territory and passed through AHPPC, or the medical expert panel \u2013 state and territory governments are responsible for the operational aspects of public health responses, and healthcare safety and quality standards.  \n   They will establish stems to promote the safety and security of people in aged care and other institutional settings and support outbreak investigation management in residential aged care facilities.  \n   I\u2019m simply setting out that a large part of that element was missed on 13 March, when the national aged care plan was released, that included, again, a joint document of commonwealth and state, the state and territory departments of health, public health section in the department will act in an advisory role to assistance residential aged care facilities to detect, categorise and manage outbreaks.  \n   This includes providing advice on testing samples, informing relevant stakeholders of outbreaks, informing clinical care providers in the local health district. I say this to draw the opposition to the fact there\u2019s shared responsibilities.  \n   We carry out the regulatory functions of aged care. What we did was establish four critical elements to protect in regards to aged care. Firstly, on 11 March, $101 million for surge workforce.  \n   On 13 March, a national agreement with public hospitals to provide surge workforce.  \n   Thirdly, on - at the end of March, we established on 31 March the private hospitals agreement and 450 patients have been transferred to those private hospitals agreements. And then finally, we have established a national testing contract for every facility, for every resident, and every staff member wherever there\u2019s a positive case. Each life lost is a source of immense regret and agony for not only those involved, but we have done those things to fight and protect Australians and that\u2019s why the loss of life in Australian aged care facilities is one of the lowest in the world. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.35am BST \n \n \n  5.19am BST  \n  \n  Michael McCormack: \n   \n   An Aboriginal woman in my electorate, auntie Gail Clark, used to remark at welcomes to country, she used to say, you may need a preacher now and again, you may need a doctor, you may need a lawyer, but you need a farmer, every day, three times a day, every day.  \n   And her message was so good, was so important, and I want to thank our farmers right across regional Australia for keeping our supermarket shelves stocked. I want to thank our truckies for getting the freight stock around the nation. I want to thank our doctors, our frontline medical personnel for the job they have done through Covid-19. They\u2019re true heroes, all the people in regional Australia who have been unfairly impacted by the restrictions that have been placed on them, and that is so unfortunate but they have done what they needed. \n   \n  I think I just had another stroke.  \n  \n Updated at 5.26am BST \n \n \n  5.17am BST  \n  \n  Michael McCormack is talking and I just do not have the capacity to deal with this today. \n  \n \n \n  5.17am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n  Today the aged care royal commissioners released a statement that 96% of private for-profit aged care facilities are failing to deliver the highest quality of care. Why is this seven-year old government failing to ensure that frail and vulnerable older Australians get the care they deserve? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   The minister for health will add further to my answer. Whether it\u2019s private operators, to which the member has referred, whether it\u2019s non-profit operators like at St Basil\u2019s, or public operators like at Oakden that sparked the royal commission, wherever the care needs to be provided, the system needs to support that care in the funding and support that is delivered by the federal government and the regulation that sits over that, which is our responsibility and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll continue to increase our funding and support and to learn the lessons that need to be learned and apply them, particularly those that will come to the royal commission. \n   \n  Greg Hunt: \n   \n   And adding to the prime minister\u2019s answer, there\u2019s four principle things which this government has done to assist, first, of course, is in relation to funding.  \n   We have increased funding from just over $13 billion to tracking towards $25.44 billion over the course of the forward estimate, that\u2019s allowed for additional home care places, additional support for residential care places, additional investment in aged care overall.  \n   Secondly, of course, this prime minister became the first prime minister in Australian history, to the best of my knowledge, to have called a royal commission. Standing next to, on the day that he announced that royal commission, he warned of the challenges, he warned of the confronting elements.  \n   He was the first person to have taken those steps precisely because he wished to shine a light from the challenges that flowed from the Oakden royal commission into public aged care in South Australia.  \n   But which had lessons for all elements of aged care, public, not-for-profit, and private. In addition, we created the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission \n   ... All of those things have come together, the funding, the royal commission, the aged care quality and safety commissioner and the national aged care mandatory program in the fight to protect, preserve standards and qualities. \n   \n  (Again, the aged care royal commission came after reports on what was still going on, and ahead of Four Corners series on it). \n  \n Updated at 5.21am BST \n \n \n  5.11am BST  \n  \n  You can find that statement here  \n  \n \n \n  5.10am BST  \n Question time begins \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n  Today the aged care royal commissioners released a statement, that nine out of 10 aged care facilities in Australia are failing to achieve the highest quality of care. Why are nine out of every 10 aged care facilities failing to deliver appropriate care that older Australians deserve? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   The challenges we face in aged care are understood, they\u2019re known, and that\u2019s why the government continues to act to support our aged care sector.  \n   That\u2019s why we continue to provide every year more than $1 billion in extra funding every year to attend to all of the issues that are necessary, that is why, Mr Speaker, understanding the system and its great needs and those needs are increasing, that is why I initiated the royal commission that the member opposite refers to.  \n   And that is why when they do their work, and they provide us with their recommendations, we\u2019ll be in a position to respond further in addition to the more than $3 billion already provided in additional support, right across the board, Mr Speaker, across all these facilities whether it\u2019s the increase in home places, whether it\u2019s dealing with chemical restraints, dealing with the standards necessary to be upheld, it\u2019s a difficult sector in which to achieve the outcomes we all desire, we will double our efforts to make sure we treat older Australians with dignity and respect. \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.08am BST  \n  \n  Before question time, there are statements from Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese on the sentencing of the Australian national far right terrorist in New Zealand. \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   Justice today was delivered in New Zealand to the terrorist and murderer for his cowardly and horrific crimes and attacks on a Christchurch mosque.  \n   The world must never see from, of him, or hear from him ever again. All Australians were and remain horrified and devastated by his despicable terrorist act.  \n   New Zealand is family to us in Australia. Today, we send our love across the ditch. And I had to opportunity to pass on those wishes directly to the New Zealand Prime Minister earlier today.  \n   But out of the horror of this event, I simply want to refer to what emerged as an incredible grace and beauty in the form of Farid Ahmed, I met with Jenny, at the memorial service in Christchurch at the time, and again when he came to visit me in Sydney in March this year.  \n   He lost his wife that day, and his message to response was not one of hate, but one of hope and of love. He is truly one of the most inspirational people I have ever met.  \n   Incredibly humbling just to be in his presence.  \n   I pay tribute to the Muslim community of New Zealand and also of Australia. Who have supported each other in these very difficult times and today will be a time when it all comes back. And it hurts again. In a way just that bit more. Then it ordinarily does. It reflects the goodness of their faith.  \n   You have been a light answering the terrible darkness. God bless you, New Zealand, our whanau this day.  \n   May it be a day of healing for everyone affected by this terrible tragedy. \n   \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   Today in New Zealand we have seen justice. A civilised response to an act that was anything but.  \n   It was an act of terrorist violence, coldly and cynically calculated to push people apart. To sow division and tear a society apart.  \n   Innocent people, defenceless, in their most sacred place, in peaceful prayer, in solemn respect of their faith.  \n   Prayer is a time that should be sacrosanct. Instead, we got the ultimate atrocity. In the end, it only succeeded in bringing the people of New Zealand closer together. We will not say the killer\u2019s name, we won\u2019t speak of him other than to acknowledge that he was one of ours. An Australian.  \n   Who cast such a terrible shade over our dear neighbour. We can only hope that from today, New Zealand can begin the long process of healing.  \n   We can only hope that after an act of such premeditated merciless cruelty, today\u2019s sentence can at least bring some small measure to those left behind. We remember every life that was lost in Christchurch on that most awful of days. For those still grieving them, wishing their loved one could one day come home again. Maybe even, maybe even today\u2019s decision may just make it a little bit easier. It won\u2019t change things.  \n   But may their sadness be softened by the knowledge their loss brought a nation together. To New Zealand, we stand with you.

We don\u2019t know. \n   The prime minister refuses to tell us. And why? Because, as [Nine] newspapers reported in 2018 \u201cChina has not agreed to do so\u201d. \n   Unlike the Morrison government, federal Labor has made it clear that we would not sign up to the BRI. \n   It\u2019s time that the Morrison government started properly managing our international relations instead of chasing headlines. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.48am BST \n \n \n  4.39am BST  \n  \n  It is no secret that New Zealand is not happy with the Australian policy of deporting people who were born in NZ, but have lived most of their lives in Australia, following the completion of prison sentences. \n  It comes up frequently in the bilateral talks. And it will come up again. But that is the context of the Winston Peters statement.  \n  \n Updated at 4.41am BST \n \n \n  4.36am BST  \n  \n  New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister wants the Australian government to take the Australian national convicted of the Christchurch far-right terrorist attack back, to complete his life without parole sentence. \n  And he singles out Peter Dutton by name in the statement: \n   \n   New Zealand First leader Winston Peters today welcomed the life without parole sentence of the Australian terrorist. \n   \u2018We applaud the sentencing of the maximum possible term, and hope this helps with the healing of those affected,\u2019 said Mr Peters. \n   \u2018The judgement is the only one that matched the depravity of the terrorist\u2019s crimes against the Islamic community, and its devastating effect on all people living in this country. \n   \u2018New Zealand First also believes this terrorist should be returned to the country that raised him. \n   \u2018Now is the time for Australia\u2019s minister of Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, to receive and carry out the terrorist\u2019s sentence in Australia,\u201d Mr Peters said. \n   \u2018The Islamic community and all of New Zealand has already suffered enough without having to pay astronomical prison costs to keep him safe in our prison system.\u2019 \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.40am BST \n \n \n  4.34am BST  \n  \n  The press club address ends and it is almost time for question time. \n  I apologise for the typos which pop up and I send all my thanks to the Guardian brainstrust who work behind the scenes cleaning up some of the transcription and finger slips. \n  I type thousands of words a day, while watching four screens, to try and get information across as quickly as possible, and sometimes that means my eyes dance over something that it should stop at. \n  Apologies.  \n  \n Updated at 4.38am BST \n \n \n  4.33am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese was also asked about how Labor would go about winning back regional seats and more conservative areas of traditional heartland. \n  We had a test recently in a regional seat. Whether you go north, south, east or west from here, Kristy McBain is the local member.  \n   \n   From Yass to Batlow, across to the coast, down to Cooma, Kristy\u2019s the local member, a real test, not a fantasy, a real test whereby for those of you who live in Canberra you will know that the Liberal party outspent us massively during that byelection campaign because you couldn\u2019t turn on a TV without getting book-ended ads during every ad break. So we\u2019ve had a test.  \n   The fact is that there\u2019s nothing new about Labor as a party of government which seeks to represent all Australians but seeks to get the support of a majority of Australians.  \n   And that means that we have to appeal very broadly. It means - I see my own seat as a bit of a microcosm of that, a seat that, yes, has some wealthier people with gentrification but also has the highest number of boarding houses of any electorate in Australia, that also has a significant multicultural population, whether it\u2019s the Portuguese in Petersham, the Chinese in Ashfield, the Greeks in Marrickville, the Lebanese in the southern part of the electorate, the Italians in Leichhardt. \n    I\u2019ve been forced each and every day that I\u2019ve been in parliament, and I wouldn\u2019t have got here were I not able to appeal to people of different backgrounds, different faiths, and to give respect to those views.  \n   I\u2019m working very strongly with multicultural communities. I\u2019ll continue to do so.  \n   And what we\u2019ve seen this week from the Liberal party is Michael Sukkar, the assistant treasurer, involved with people in Victoria who used a derogatory term to people of background from - not Mr Sukkar but the group involved - of people from subcontinent backgrounds using people in a ways that entirely inappropriate.  \n   Michael Sukkar\u2019s still sitting in the parliament as the assistant treasurer in spite of the fact that each day Nine newspapers have had new revelations. Compare that with the action that I took when I saw inappropriate behaviour in my party. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.14am BST \n \n \n  4.23am BST  \n  \n  The Labor leader is asked if he is ready for the election to be held next year, and what ground he thinks he could win on, given the wide range of government policies in response to the pandemic. \n  He invokes Ronald Reagan in his answer, in what was his successful campaign against Jimmy Carter: \n   \n   I expect the election will be some time between August 2021 and May 2022, and I\u2019ll be ready each and every one of those days.  \n   As will my entire team.  \n   One of the things that we\u2019ve done during this period is develop a draft platform for the party, a whole range of policies, that we\u2019ve used the time that we have through a range of shadow cabinet subcommittees that we have to be able to go forward whenever the button is pressed.  \n   We will have a smaller agenda than Labor took to the last election.  \n   That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a less ambitious agenda.  \n   It just means that when you\u2019ve got 284 things to talk about, that\u2019s a very long doorknock if you want to go through the list.  \n   And what I want is, as Labor leader, to have a series of commitments that are clearly understood, that are able to be articulated in a clear way.  \n   And I believe we\u2019re well-positioned.  \n   I think that by the time we get to the next election ... the government will be shooting for more than a decade in office, longer than the Howard government, is what they\u2019ll be asking for.  \n   So say what you like about John Howard, I was critical of a range of measures that he had, but you knew what he stood for.  \n   You speak about Scott Morrison, you know, shifting to the centre, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of that. I think it\u2019s just a matter of Scott Morrison being shifty.  \n   And the fact is that at the time of the next election people will be asking themselves, \u2018Am I better off than I was in 2013?\u2019 \n   What are the economic, social or environmental reforms that the Coalition government of eight or nine years standing, shooting for more than a decade, will be remembered for?\u201d  \n   I know what our legacy is from our short time in office. In terms of the Rudd and Gillard governments \u2013 it\u2019s Labor governments that change things.  \n   It\u2019s Labor governments that do the big reforms.  \n   It\u2019s Labor governments that will be required, the values that will be required, to take us into the economic recovery.  \n   And I believe we will be successful at the next election.  \n   But that will be a matter for the Australian people, but we will have a strong, coherent narrative about growing the economy, about supporting jobs as the core principle but also about good social policy including looking after vulnerable Australians, not leaving people behind, as well as acting on environmental challenges such as climate change. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.28am BST \n \n \n  4.19am BST  \n  \n  Does Anthony Albanese support stronger national control on state border closures? \n  Albanese: \n   \n   I make two points, and you quite rightly identified that I haven\u2019t singled out premiers. I\u2019ve been consistent and said that two issues apply here. One is that the state leaders, in the absence of national leadership, need to listen to their respective state medical advisors, the chief medical officer, they have different titles in different states. I certainly think, when you look at Western Australia, for example, I\u2019ve been very critical of the federal government joining in with Clive Palmer on an appeal.  \n   I was with Mark McGowan, I was against Clive Palmer and Scott Morrison on that issue. Queensland were singled out by the government as well. \n   Annastacia Palaszczuk \u2013 I think people look back at when that criticism was made and probably think that it [the border closure] served Queensland well.  \n   My concern is, of course, the national cabinet \u2013 so that\u2019s the first point.  \n   And the same [time] Tasmania and South Australia have, of course, had closed borders but the federal government has ignored them.  \n   I think that in terms of the national cabinet, what is very obvious now is that it isn\u2019t a national cabinet.  \n   From the Sunday when Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews essentially stood Scott Morrison up on school closures, what happens now at so-called national cabinet is state premiers all tell each other what they\u2019re doing and Scott Morrison goes out and announces it and pretends it is national decision, then spends the time in between the national cabinet meetings criticising the decision that he\u2019s been a part of.  \n   That\u2019s not a cabinet. And I do think that it\u2019s up to Scott Morrison to explain why it is that there isn\u2019t a national approach to these issues, including borders.  \n   It\u2019s up to him to explain. He made the decision to have a so-called national cabinet that excluded the federal opposition, and I haven\u2019t complained about that, that\u2019s a decision for him.  \n   But he has a responsibility for it. It\u2019s up to him to explain the contradiction that\u2019s there between pretending there\u2019s a cabinet when there\u2019s clearly nothing like cabinet-based decision making. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.24am BST \n \n \n  4.11am BST  \n  \n  Does Labor support the foreign veto legislation? \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   We\u2019ll examine the legislation, but the idea that the national interests should be looked after by the federal government when it comes to foreign policy is something that we\u2019re very supportive of, [which] I would regard as completely unremarkable.  \n   What I do find remarkable for the government to answer is why Simon Birmingham indeed welcomed the Victorian decision over BRI and why it is that the federal government sat by and allowed the Port of Darwin to be sold off to a company that is connected with a non-Australian government and at the time \u2013 not in retrospect \u2013 at the time, as the infrastructure spokesperson, I was very critical of that decision. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.17am BST \n \n \n  4.10am BST  \n  \n  Should Australia\u2019s aged care sector be restructured so it is not-for-profit? \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   What we will do is wait for the final report of the royal commission but what\u2019s very clear is that once you moved from essentially a public system into the privatisation of a whole section of the sector, that needed to be accompanied by very strong regulation.  \n   By strong inspection processes, by making sure that there was transparency, the sort of transparency that I have spoken about today that the royal commissioners have spoken about.  \n   So we will come up with a more comprehensive long-term plan for aged care after the royal commission finalises its report at the beginning of next year.  \n   But what is very clear is that the problems that have arisen, if you look at where they are, they are ... almost exclusively in the for-profit system at the moment, and that should tell the story about a failure to properly regulate the system, which is the commonwealth\u2019s responsibility. \n   \n  (It was the Howard government which privatised aged care). \n  \n Updated at 4.16am BST \n \n \n  4.08am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese is asked whether or not both parties need to take responsibility for what has happened in aged care, given that none of these issues are new: \n  The truth is that we need to do better. That\u2019s the truth. The entire political system.  \n   \n   But it\u2019s also the truth that the interim report came down on 31 October last year. I responded with my fourth vision statement, which was on respecting and valuing older Australians, given in Brisbane before the pandemic, before this issue.  \n   I was talking about workforce issues, I was talking about what we needed to do to address this issue. The government says that it responded to the interim report, tick done. Quite clearly if this is post-response to the interim report, it\u2019s simply not good enough. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.14am BST \n \n \n  4.02am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese finishes his speech along these lines: \n   \n   At every step of the way they have been dragged to these actions because these values go against their deepest instincts of a nation divided into winners and losers. \n   Likewise, only Labor values will carry us to recovery. \n   This unnerves the Liberals. Finding themselves in alien territory, they have panicked and run for the comfort of the familiar. \n   You saw it with Treasurer Frydenberg recently when he announced his inspiration for the recovery was ... Margaret Thatcher. \n   Margaret Thatcher \u2014 the prime minister who declared there was no such thing as society. \n   The prime minister who let the more vulnerable regions of her country slide into ruin. \n   Treasurer Frydenberg was admonished by Scott Morrison \u2014 not because he had said something wrong, but because he\u2019d said the quiet bit out loud. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.14am BST \n \n \n  4.00am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison has responded to the sentencing of the Australian national far-right terrorist on his Facebook page: \n   \n   Justice today was delivered to the terrorist and murderer for his cowardly and horrific crimes in Christchurch. It is right that we will never see or hear from him ever again. \n   All Australians were horrified and devastated by his despicable act. \n   New Zealand is family to us. Today, we send our love across \u2018the ditch\u2019 and I had the opportunity to pass on those wishes earlier today to New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern. \n   Out of the horror of this event there also emerged the incredible grace and beauty of Farid Ahmed, who I met with Jenny at the memorial service in Christchurch and again in Sydney when he came to visit me in March this year. \n   Farid lost his wife that day and his message is one of hope and love. Inspirational. \n   I pay tribute to the Muslim community of New Zealand and in Australia who have supported each other and reflected the goodness of faith. You have been a light answering the darkness. \n   God Bless our New Zealand whanau this day \u2013 and may it be another day of healing for everyone affected by this terrible atrocity. \n   \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.13am BST \n \n \n  3.59am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   Scott Morrison has had to be dragged to nearly every important decision during this pandemic. \n   In the words of a columnist for the Australian, Niki Savva: \n   \u2018At almost every critical point on almost every contentious issue, he has been forced to shift position. He stopped travel from China but waited too long to block travel from the US. He opposed lockdowns, he opposed school closures, he opposed state border restrictions, he opposed wage subsidies, he opposed pandemic leave and he suspended parliament.\u2019 \n   This records the lack of judgment and a complacency. \n   Complacency first, demonstrated so tragically during the bushfires. \n   I can\u2019t help but wonder how much better shape Australia would be in if the government hadn\u2019t put so much energy into resisting what was obvious and essential. \n   Labor has made suggestions during this crisis, and we have been constructive. We want to help Australia\u2019s recovery, not hinder it. \n   We want solutions, not arguments. \n   But when it\u2019s the government that is acting as a drag on our recovery, then we have a responsibility to speak up. \n   The actions taken by the government to assist people and business during the pandemic, including wage subsidies, have been based on Labor values \u2013 the power of government to make a positive difference; the belief that no one should be left behind during the pandemic, and no one held back during the recovery. \n   The value written in every Australian heart: the fair go. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.07am BST \n \n \n  3.57am BST  \n  \n  We are getting to the pointy end of this speech. \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   When Harry Truman was president of the US, he had a sign on his desk in the Oval Office that said \u2018The buck stops here.\u2019 \n   It was an expression of the very core of leadership: the acceptance of the responsibility that comes with it. \n   Not Scott Morrison. \n   The buck doesn\u2019t stop with him. And, as the Ruby Princess debacle showed, neither do the boats \u2014 no matter what that little trinket in his office says. \n   It is just one more monument to the emptiness of his promises. \n   As hollow as his promise to drought victims. \n   As hollow as his promise to bushfire victims. \n   And ultimately, as hollow as his campaign launch promise to all Australians. \n   The prime minister can try to sidestep the truth all he wants. He can dismiss valid questions from journalists as \u201cgossip\u201d or \u201cinside the Canberra bubble\u201d. \n   He can pretend that his government\u2019s pattern of inaction and its very real consequences is nothing more than the trivial obsession of political insiders. He can try to reframe reality. \n   But it changes nothing. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.16am BST \n \n \n  3.51am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   In this atmosphere of uncertainty, the government has found a receptive audience with its invitation to Australians to raid their own superannuation. \n   Boil it down to its essence and what the government has done is ask workers to fund their own stimulus with this early release scheme. \n   And who has been most receptive to this idea? \n   Young workers. Women. Those who are already at a disadvantage, and who cannot afford the hit to their savings. \n   So far, $33 billion has been withdrawn \u2014 comparable to and on the same scale as what the government has paid out on jobkeeper. \n   More than 600,000 superannuation accounts have been reduced to zero. \n   This is as sneaky as it is wicked.  \n   The government has shifted the cost of the pandemic from themselves to individuals \u2014 making workers and families pay for the pandemic by depleting their retirement incomes. \n   And they are withdrawing their super at the bottom of the market. \n   What\u2019s happening right now is casting a shadow so long it will darken future generations. \n   It will increasingly fall to them to prop up budget spending ever more on aged care and pensions. \n   This means either that future workers will face higher taxation or that future government services \u2014 including the age pension \u2014 will come under pressure. \n   Universal superannuation was built to avoid this problem. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.56am BST \n \n \n  3.49am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   Whatever questions are raised by the current circumstances, Richard Colbeck cannot be the answer to any of them. \n   There are few greater indictments on this government than Minister Colbeck\u2019s performance last week before the Senate select committee on Covid-19, led by Katy Gallagher. \n   As he fumbled about with pieces of paper, it became clear that even the absolute basics of his job were beyond him. \n   We saw the heights of his ineptitude. \n   The fact is our aged care sector has one of the highest Covid death rates in the world. \n   Scott Morrison\u2019s response?: \u2018When it rains, everyone gets wet.\u2019 \n   Yes, he really said that. He knew the rain was coming. He never thought to give anyone an umbrella. \n   In the absence of a government plan, here are eight points the government could consider: \n   1:Minimum staffing levels in residential aged care; \n   2:Reduce the homecare package waiting list so more people can stay in their homes for longer; \n   3:Ensure transparency and accountability of funding to support high quality care; \n   4:Independent measurement and public reporting, as recommended by the royal commission this week; \n   5:Ensure every residential aged care facility has adequate personal protective equipment; \n   6:Better training for staff, including on infection control; \n   7:A better surge workforce strategy; and \n   8:Provide additional resources so the aged care royal commission can inquire specifically into Covid-19 across the sector while not impacting or delaying the handing down of the final report. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.54am BST \n \n \n  3.43am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   None of what is going wrong just crept up on us. This government was warned by experts that our already troubled aged care system was vulnerable to the pandemic. \n   Just as they were warned in the past by experts that a terrible fire season was coming. \n   Just as they have been warned by experts that the climate is changing, and inaction will cost us more in the long run. \n   Just as they have been warned by experts that wages are flatlining and working people are being left behind. \n   Just as they are now being warned by experts that the raids they are encouraging on superannuation will leave people much worse off later in life. \n   Their response to each warning has been the same: neglect. And the smirk of someone who is convinced he knows better, and then sits on his hands. \n   If actions speak louder than words, Scott Morrison is truly the quietest Australian of all. \n   \n  We have heard that last line a couple of times now - you can see how Labor is attempting to shape its attacks against the government, now that the immediate crisis of the pandemic is (thankfully) passing (for now). \n  \n Updated at 3.45am BST \n \n \n  3.36am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese: \n   \n   At his campaign launch last year, Scott Morrison vowed to \u201ckeep the promise of Australia to all Australians\u201d. \n   All Australians. \n   But then, this is also the same Scott Morrison who has repeatedly asked the question, \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d \n   Which is the real Scott Morrison? This year has answered the question. \n   He is a man who has climbed to the highest office of the land without even accidentally gaining any of the necessary compassion along the way. \n   A Prime Minister who doesn\u2019t hold a hose. \n   It\u2019s a handy metaphor he\u2019s given us. The hose can stand for anything he is shirking responsibility for, anything he\u2019s trying to keep his fingerprints off. \n   Indeed, the last time Scott Morrison held anything with conviction was a lump of coal he carried into the Parliament. \n   Time and again, this Government has been warned about the threat the coronavirus posed to aged care. Time and again those warnings have been neglected.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.54am BST \n \n \n  3.32am BST  \n Anthony Albanese at the National Press Club \n  \n  Anthony Albanese has begun his press club address. \n  He is wearing Rabbitoh colours on his tie, because everything is politics.  \n  \n Updated at 3.37am BST \n \n \n  3.24am BST  \n  \n  Here is that suspension of standing orders which was shut down: \n   \n   \n    The Morrison Gov's addiction to shutting down discussion hit a new low. I moved a motion backing the TGA which strongly discourages the use of hydroxychloroquine. @GregHuntMP and the Gov voted to shut down debate but lets Craig Kelly make ludicrous claims dismissed by the experts pic.twitter.com/o6uPeufFIr\u2014 Chris Bowen (@Bowenchris) August 27, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.20am BST  \n  \n  The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is still answering questions, and he is being pressed about the prime minister pursuing new powers to stop state and territory governments entering agreements with foreign governments. This obviously calls the Victorian government\u2019s Belt and Road agreement with China into question.  \n  Asked if this was threatening the state\u2019s sovereignty, Andrews says;  \n   \n   Exports will always be important no matter what country they\u2019re being sent to. And no matter what product it is ... I will always advocate on behalf of Victorian business and will always advocate on behalf of Victorian jobs. That\u2019s a really important part of our part of our job. But the most important job at the moment, again, in my judgement, is to be focused exclusively on this second wave, getting past it. And making sure that we can then open up and that we can repair the damage that this pandemic has done in so many different, different ways. \n   Foreign affairs is a matter for the commonwealth government, but growing jobs and sending Victorian products overseas and helping businesses to be more profitable and employ more people ... that\u2019s a pretty big part of my job too. \n   \n  He just added: \n   \n   The prime minister\u2019s got time to be doing those things, then that\u2019s, that\u2019s fine for him. I don\u2019t, I am exclusively focused on fighting this virus, and then making sure that we have got the strongest economy that we can possibly have on the other side of this concern about the impact on trade. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.31am BST \n \n \n  3.19am BST  \n  \n  Labor has responded to the life without parole sentence of the rightwing Australian-born terrorist in New Zealand: \n   \n   Labor hopes the sentencing of an Australian-born terrorist and rightwing extremist in New Zealand will serve justice to the victims of the Christchurch shootings and a sense of closure for their family members. \n   The individual was sentenced in New Zealand\u2019s high court for the murder of 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques and 40 attempted murders on 15 March 2019, along with one charge of terrorism. \n   The Australian-born terrorist and rightwing extremist has been sentenced to the maximum penalty of a life sentence without parole \u2013 a first for New Zealand. \n   The individual who committed these heinous attacks is not simply a \u201cgunman\u201d \u2013 he is a violent rightwing extremist, a terrorist and a white supremacist who committed a horrendous act, driven by hate and fear. \n   This individual\u2019s vile ideology and its sources should be named and condemned. Addressing this serious threat begins with acknowledging and correctly naming it. \n   Regrettably, we still have not had a serious conversation about how this individual was radicalised or how much of this occurred in Australia. But it is clear that at least some of these ugly ideas would have been shaped by conversations and ideas prevalent here. \n   This individual\u2019s actions also highlight the growing transnational and online nature of the problem \u2013 with at least two further attacks inspired by the violence perpetrated in Christchurch. \n   The parliament, media and wider community must take the threat of rightwing extremism seriously. \n   As the Asio director general has warned, we cannot ignore the fact that rightwing extremism is a growing and a real terrorist threat in our nation and the world. \n   We cannot allow vacuums to develop that can legitimise views or legitimise people who want to sow discord and racism in our diverse, multicultural and multi-faith community. \n   Australians stand in solidarity with our New Zealand sisters and brothers \u2013 we will always unite with them against racism, hatred, fear and division. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.28am BST \n \n \n  3.14am BST  \n  \n  The ABS has released its latest business impacts survey. \n  I\u2019ll let its head of industry statistics, John Shepherd, explain: \n  More than a third (35%) of Australian businesses expect to find it difficult or very difficult to meet financial commitments over the next three months, according to the latest results from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).The Business Impacts of Covid-19 Survey found that small businesses were almost twice as likely to report that they expected to find it difficult or very difficult compared to large businesses (35% compared to 18%).ABS Head of Industry Statistics, John Shepherd, said: \u201c41 per cent of businesses reported that revenue had fallen over the last month and 22 per cent had an increase in operating expenses.\u201cIn addition, 28 per cent of businesses expected a decrease in revenue over the next month.\u201dThe survey also includes insights about how business expenditure on capital has changed over the last three months.Shepherd said: \u201cAlmost a quarter of businesses (23 per cent) reported they had decreased or cancelled their actual or planned capital expenditure compared to three months earlier.\u201cBusinesses reported that their decisions related to expenditure on capital were significantly influenced by uncertainty about the future state of the economy (59 per cent), and future expected customer demand for their products or services (40 per cent).\u201d \n  \n Updated at 3.24am BST \n \n \n  3.06am BST  \n  \n  Federal Labor looks like it is on board, in general terms, with the foreign investment veto powers the Morrison government wants. \n  Scott Morrison said he spoke to the premiers last night about the plan.

CEO Narita Waight said the lockdown was creating wider family violence issues. \n  \u201cPeople are concerned about what\u2019s going on in terms of intimate partner relationships, exposing concerns around that, but also when you\u2019ve got multiple generations living in a home in a confined environment, that is also creating wider family violence repercussions.\u201d \n  \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Claire Febey, an executive director at the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions, told a judicial inquiry on Thursday when the scheme was created in late March she had \u201cescalated\u201d her concerns for the police to have an ongoing presence at each hotel.  \n  \u201cI continued to press the issue, but gained no traction,\u201d she said in a witness statement.  \n  The inquiry was told Victoria police had wanted private security guards to be the \u201cfirst line of security\u201d.  \n  \u201cThe views expressed by Victoria Police in the First [State Control Centre] Meeting confirmed that private security would be required and shaped DJPR\u2019s assumptions regarding the level of support that would be needed,\u201d Febey said in her statement.  \n  Febey said she understood that she would be responsible for contracting security companies for the program, but could not say who made the initial decision that private guards would be required. \n  The inquiry is continuing this morning. \n  \n Updated at 2.45am BST \n \n \n  2.43am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews says he will let the multi-parliament working group to work out whether or not there can be virtual voting at next week\u2019s state parliament sitting. \n  On whether or not he would accept a six-month extension to the Victorian state of emergency declaration, he says: \n   \n   I\u2019m motivated to work as closely as we can in a roomful and collaborative way as possible - not just on these measures, the but this is the approach we take with the crossbench on everything.  \n   No matter the subject matter.  \n   It will be the approach we continue to take on many and varied issues they will raise with us, we will raise with them. It\u2019s been a very positive process. It\u2019s not quite - not concluded yet. We are having very productive discussions.  \n   Again, as I said earlier on, not for the imposition of rules to keep the place closed, but making sure there\u2019s certainty so we can put in place a plan and a set of rules that allow us to open up. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.  \n   Where that lands in an ultimate sense, we will have to wait and see. But I\u2019m confident through the discussions and, again, I will say thank you to the crossbenchers for the way - the positive way - in which they are engaging with us  \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.35am BST  \n NSW records nine new cases of Covid-19 \n  \n  NSW has reported nine new cases of Covid have been diagnosed in the last 24 hours. \n  From NSW Health: \n  There were 30,173 tests reported in the 24-hour reporting period, compared with 25,874 in the previous 24 hours. \n  All of today\u2019s new cases were locally acquired and linked to known cases, including: \n   \n   five linked to the Sydney CBD cluster \n   four close contacts of previous cases \n   \n  Three of the new cases attended City Tattersalls Club gym, bringing to eight the total number of cases linked to the Sydney CBD cluster. Anyone who attended City Tattersalls gym between 8am to 2pm on 19, 21 or 23 August is a close contact and must get tested for Covid-19 and isolate at home for 14 days. Other members of City Tattersalls should get tested if they have even the mildest symptoms. \n  Cases have attended the following locations while infectious. \n  NSW Health is contacting all known attendees of the Hunters Hill Bowling Club indoor dining room on 23 August from 12pm to 2pm to advise they are close contacts of a case and must immediately get tested and self-isolate for 14 days, and remain isolated for the entire period, even if the test result is negative. People who attended other areas of the club are considered close contacts and must monitor for symptoms and get tested if they develop. \n  People who attended the following locations are considered casual contacts and must monitor for symptoms and if they develop, get tested right away and isolate: \n   \n   4Pines Manly Brew Bar, The Esplanade \u2013 23 August from 3.30pm to 5pm \n   Magpies Waitara restaurant \u2013 24 August from 11.30am to 1:15pm \n   Fitness First Balgowlah \u2013 23 August from 9am to 12pm (NSW Health is calling to advise any close contacts who must immediately self-isolate for 14 days) \n   Destro\u2019s Pharmacy, 197-201 Victoria Road Drummoyne \u2013 22 August from 11.20am to 11.40am \n   Fitness First Bond St \u2013 20 and 21 August in the afternoon (NSW Health is calling to advise any close contacts who must immediately self-isolate for 14 days) \n   \n  There are currently 74 Covid-19 cases being treated by NSW Health. There are six Covid-19 patients in intensive care and four are ventilated. 85 per cent of cases being treated by NSW Health are in non-acute, out-of-hospital care. \n  \n Updated at 2.39am BST \n \n \n  2.33am BST  \n  \n  Amid the current tensions in the relationship with China, Australia is one of 10 nations participating in the US-led Rimpac military exercises in Hawaii. \n  US Navy vice-admiral, commander of the Third Fleet Scott D. Conn, has been briefing reporters on the exercises. He argued they demonstrated how allies and partners were able to come together and respond to any crises \u2013 and the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. \n  They also demonstrated \u201cto ourselves and the world that we can come together and [carry out] the mission in spite of all the challenges we face in the Covid environment\u201d. \n  Conn said Australia played a large role in the Rimpac exercises. He said his lead planner for Rimpac was from Australia. \n  Australia and the US agreed at the recent Ausmin talks to deepen defence cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region - but Australia apparently resisted pressure for it to join freedom of navigation exercises within 12 nautical miles of disputed features. \n  When asked by Guardian Australia about what this additional cooperation between Australia and the US would look like, Conn simply said that both sides \u201clook for all opportunities to continue to strengthen our very strong relationship\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 2.37am BST \n \n \n  2.31am BST  \n  \n  Prof Allen Cheng says the last R number he heard for Victoria was 0.87. \n   \n   But obviously that is a retrospective number that is estimated. So that\u2019s going from about two weeks ago and that\u2019s the sort of the latest you can do that. I would expect it to be a bit lower than that at the moment. It\u2019s certainly encouraging and below one, which is where we want it to be. \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.25am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews then speaks on the proposal to extend Victoria\u2019s state of emergency declaration beyond September: \n   \n   Just finally, I would just again make the point, as I did yesterday, [we\u2019re] very grateful to members of the crossbench, we\u2019re having very, very productive discussions with them, and I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll get to an outcome that both protects public health and gives us the rules that we need to plan to open.  \n   Not rules to stay closed. But indeed, rules that will assist us in putting together a longterm plan to repair the damage, to get people back to work, to get businesses up and running again, and to \u2013 as I said many times \u2013 to find that Covid normal.  \n   [We\u2019re] very, very grateful to those crossbench members. We\u2019ve been, as we always do, engaging with them in good faith, and those discussions are progressing very well. And we\u2019ll have obviously more to say about that as we get into the sitting week next week.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.29am BST \n \n \n  2.23am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   We\u2019ve got to defeat this second wave before we begin opening up, or we\u2019ll be in the early stages of a third wave, and while there may be some significant respite for people for a short period of time, we\u2019ll be in even worse circumstances very, very quickly.  \n   That\u2019s what our experts tell us. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t open up right now. But every Victorian should be clear about the government\u2019s intentions, all the team is working as hard as we can. We want to get past this is a quickly as we can.  \n   The rules won\u2019t be in place for longer than they need to be.  \n   We\u2019ll have many announcements to make about repairing the damage this global pandemic has done.  \n   There will be a singular focus on jobs, on making sure we look after those who lost work, we look after those who are really facing very difficult circumstances in terms of their business, and their prospects for the future.  \n   There is, in every sense, cause for people to be positive about the fact that this strategy is working.  \n   And we will get past this. We\u2019ll defeat this thing, we\u2019ll get past this second wave, and then we\u2019ll all be able to open up, we\u2019ll be able to begin that long and challenging process.  \n   But one I think we\u2019re equal to, of repairing the damage this pandemic has done to all of us, across the board. In businesses large and small, communities large and small, families, individuals, we will get that strength back.  \n   We\u2019ll resume that position of national leadership where Victorians are always at their best. When we\u2019re out in front and leading.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.27am BST \n \n \n  2.21am BST  \n  \n  And then we get some talk of hope. \n  Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   Just finally, Victorians are doing an amazing job.  \n   They\u2019re doing an absolutely amazing job in very challenging and difficult circumstances.  \n   I think that every Victorian can be positive about the fact these numbers are coming down.  \n   There will come a time, hopefully soon, we\u2019ll see those numbers in double digits and we can have with greater confidence a really clear discussion about what the back end of September looks like, what October, November, December looks like, pushing into 2021.  \n   That will take two different forms \u2013 both a clear plan, very detailed, indeed, a massive plan to repair the damage this pandemic has done, make sure that jobs and skills and strength across our economy and communities are at the forefront of every single thing we do, and as best we can. It always has to be heavily caveated, I suppose, in terms of daily numbers, but as best we can, we hope to give people a roadmap, a clear plan about what coming out of stage four looks like, what opening up looks like, what finding Covid normal looks like.  \n   I appreciate, I know and understand, very deeply, how challenging this is. But this strategy is working.  \n   These numbers are coming down. Of course, that shouldn\u2019t take away from the pain and the loss that those 23 families today are dealing with.  \n   And sadly, there will be more tomorrow. That\u2019s the nature of this wildly infectious virus.  \n   The alternative to this, to basically ignore the fact this is transmitted very quickly, that it is a wicked enemy, and that we would, if we didn\u2019t have these very challenging rules in place, we would simply see our hospital system completely and utterly overrun.  \n   And that\u2019s not just a matter of Covid patients not getting the care they need, but people who every day, heart attacks, strokes, motor vehicle accidents, people who need urgent care, they simply would miss out also.  \n   As challenging as this is, the strategy is working. We do have to all of us look out for each other, provide whatever support we can to get to the other side of this. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.26am BST \n \n \n  2.18am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews says Victoria will be increasing the number of orange door centres - hubs where people fleeing domestic and family violence can find help. \n  He also makes clear that if you are in danger, you can of course leave your home, despite the lockdown: \n   \n   Despite the fact we have stage four lockdown in metropolitan Melbourne, stage three in regional Victoria, it\u2019s always permissible, always appropriate, if you feel like you need to leave home for your safety, if there\u2019s a family violence issue, then of course you\u2019re able to do it.  \n   You\u2019re not going to get into any trouble for going and getting the care that you need, getting away from that violence \u2013 that is a point that\u2019s worth making, just so there\u2019s no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind.  \n   We have a very strong record of investing in this sector. It is always disappointing to have to invest this sort of money, we would prefer to see far less of this sort of behaviour, but whether it be trying to change attitudes towards women and therefore outcomes for women, all the way through to very practical investments in the support system that is critical to providing safety and security and not just changing lives, but saving lives, then this is work that continues.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.20am BST \n \n \n  2.14am BST  \n  \n  On the number of active cases, Daniel Andrews says: \n   \n   There\u2019s 3,308 active cases across the state. Those numbers continue to fall, which is good news. In terms of the regional-metro split, as I always point out, these numbers don\u2019t perfectly reconcile just because there\u2019s a number still being investigated. But there\u2019s now 198 active cases in regional local government areas under stage three.  \n   To give you an example, across a number of key regional communities that we\u2019ve been speaking about, they\u2019re key for that purpose, Geelong, the greater Geelong area, 71 active cases, greater Bendigo, 16, and Ballarat has six active cases. That\u2019s a much better position than a few weeks ago.  \n   Those numbers are falling. Those numbers will continue to fall as people go through their active period as a positive, and then we\u2019ll see those numbers continue to fall. But there should be no sense of complacency in those communities or any community.  \n   Regional Victorian numbers are low, we\u2019re doing everything we can in a very strong partnership between the government, public health team, all the workers in this, as well as families right across regional Victoria, communities right across regional Victoria, we\u2019ve got to continue to do everything we can to keep those numbers low.  \n   But that\u2019s a pleasing decrease and a steady decrease in terms of the number of active cases.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.26am BST \n \n \n  2.09am BST  \n Daniel Andrews press conference \n  \n  23 deaths is one of the worst days we have seen during this pandemic. \n  The Victorian premier goes through what we are allowed to know of them: \n   \n   They include one male in their 60s, one female and four males in their 70s, six females and three males in their 80s and five females and three males in their 90s. 22 of those 23 deaths are linked to aged care outbreaks.  \n   There are 532 Victorians in hospital. 29 of those are receiving intensive care and 11 of the 29 are on a ventilator. \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.56am BST  \n  \n  I am hearing that Craig Kelly, never one to let an opportunity for promotion go by, headed into the federation chamber (where speeches go to die) to double down on his hydroxychloroquine conspiracy theories, after the government gagged a Labor motion to suspend standing orders and address it.  \n  Siiiiiiiggggggghhhhhhhhh. \n  \n Updated at 2.02am BST \n \n \n  1.51am BST  \n  \n  It\u2019s worth pointing out how much the debate has shifted in Australia \u2013 and other countries \u2013 on Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative over the past few years. \n  In an interview with Sky News in June 2018, the then trade minister, Steve Ciobo, was asked about Australia engaging with it, and said \u201cthere\u2019s certainly scope for Australian businesses to be involved in the Belt Road Initiative\u201d. \n  He said history showed such pathways for trade had driven prosperity and peace.  \n  As for government involvement, he said Australia would \u201cengage in relation to this\u201d. Ciobo said at the time: \n  \u201cI mean, the bulk of the Belt Road Initiative is in relation to infrastructure. And as I said, Australia has a terrific track record with project financing, design, construction, maintenance, repair, all these types of things.  \n  So we can certainly work together, and in fact when I was last in China, we signed an MOU for cooperation in third countries on Belt Road Initiative and other initiatives that we can do together. So we are playing a constructive and active role in that space right now.\u201d \n  Given the apparent move against the Victorian deal with today\u2019s announcement, Scott Morrison was asked at the press conference to explain the status of that 2017 MoU between the Australian and Chinese governments. \n  He replied that the arrangement reached with Ciobo in 2017 \u201cwas about cooperating in third party markets\u201d. \n  \u201cIt did not sign up or endorse BRI. That was not an arrangement that endorsed the BRI.  \n  It\u2019s never been our government\u2019s policy, under myself or the previous prime minister, that we signed up to or endorsed the BRI. That was not such an agreement in those terms.\u201d \n  Earlier in the press conference, Morrison stressed the need for transparency. The federal government has previously refused to release this MoU.  \n  When an FoI application was rejected, Ciobo said \u201cboth parties are required to agree to release the text of the MOU and China has not agreed to do so\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 1.56am BST \n \n \n  1.40am BST  \n  \n  After a huge amount of pushback, Daniel Andrews looks like paring back his request to the parliament to extend Victoria\u2019s state of emergency from the 12 months he announced on Monday, to six months. \n  A week is a long time in politics. Practically a lifetime these days. \n  Scott Morrison is asked about it: \n   \n   It\u2019s a call he has to make. And the nature of those laws in Victoria are different to how the laws work in New South Wales, which I understand are sort of open-ended arrangements to how their legislation is set up.  \n   I think the concern the other day was the shock and the surprise to Victorians who were already in a pretty fragile and sensitive state.  \n   And I\u2019m pleased there\u2019s been greater clarity around what the premier announced. I wasn\u2019t the only person asking for that. I communicated that to him as a concern, as I indicated to you yesterday.  \n   I\u2019m sure Victorians are relieved and pleased to know there\u2019s not \u2013 not just another 12 months of lockdown, there\u2019s not enough six months of lockdown. There\u2019s a matter for the premier to deal with through his parliament and what they agreed to provide. We have had our arrangements on a rolling three-month review and we deal with that and review it regularly.  \n   This is why I was pleased to come to an agreement with the New South Wales premier that particularly when it comes on the issue the foreign minister and I have been working on, in terms of residents returning to Australia, we\u2019re reviewing the caps on a fortnightly basis based on the most recent information.  \n   One of the key lessons in the pandemic, you need to take things as they come. You need to deal with the information in front of you, because it changes rapidly. Lock yourself in too far out, and you can find circumstances change. Sure, you\u2019ve got to give as much certainty as you can, and you\u2019ve got to show the direction, the direction I want to clearly set is to reopen Australia again, just like we did back in June, and we\u2019ve had a huge setback in Victoria, but we need to get back on that horse and go forward. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.42am BST \n \n \n  1.37am BST  \n  \n  Q: Prime minister, the report that was released this week into the Newmarch House outbreak, earlier this year, revealed that there were mistakes that was made in that house that were repeated, repeatedly, in Victoria, especially at St Basil\u2019s, issues with food and with staff being furloughed \u2013 given that this was months later and you\u2019ve repeatedly said, and Richard Colbeck has repeatedly said lessons would be heard, given we\u2019re seeing dozens of people dying in Victorian aged care facilities, why weren\u2019t these lessons learned?  \n  Why were mistakes repeated? And who is to be held accountable? \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   I don\u2019t share your analysis completely on that. I responded to a question on this in the House yesterday, where I set out the key findings and learning of the Newmarch report, and how they had been specifically applied, including in the case of St Basil\u2019s, as well as a whole range of other facilities, and the events that unfolded with the Covid pandemic in Victoria, which had moved to a level we had not yet seen in Australia, and, as we know, have impacted healthcare facilities in Victoria and many other facilities in Victoria. \n   Whether it\u2019s the aged care providers themselves who had been made aware of what was necessary in these circumstances, or the responsibilities of the federal government and the actions of the public health agencies, these lessons were certainly sought to be implemented in all of these cases, and the fact that, as I\u2019ve reminded you all on a number of occasions now, in the UK, 56% of aged care facilities have had resident and staff. \n   That figure in Australia is 8%. 8%. And the number of facilities that have been acutely affected in Victoria has been four. Out of over 700 facilities in that state. Now, those four circumstances were unacceptable outcomes. And we\u2019ve been very clear about that.  \n   My fear when the Covid pandemic hit in Victoria was that we could have potentially seen far more. Because of the scale of that outbreak.  \n   And as horrific as those four cases were, I\u2019m so pleased it did not extend to so many more and the fact that we\u2019ve reduced it down from 13 that we were watching very carefully, that didn\u2019t all escalate to the levels we saw at Epping Gardens and St Basil\u2019s and others, that\u2019s come down to three, and that\u2019s real issues in those three facilities and we\u2019re monitoring them closely every single day. We\u2019re dealing with a global pandemic where there\u2019s no guarantees.  \n   The only guarantee we can give you is of complete effort that dealing with every situation that presents. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.44am BST \n \n \n  1.34am BST  \n  \n  Given the Liberal party is the party of individual rights \u2013 including for the states \u2013 how does this proposed legislation sit with that history? \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   In terms of our history of federalism, I\u2019m a passionate federalist.  \n   That\u2019s why I moved to establish the national cabinet because I know we get a lot more done together and the responsibilities of the states are very significant, whether it be on healthcare or on schools or on planning approvals and all of these sorts of things \u2013 there are many things that we can\u2019t achieve in protecting the lives of Australians and the livelihoods of Australians if we don\u2019t work together.  \n   And I\u2019m not seeking to change any of the powers here. I\u2019m seeking to ensure that the powers that we have, and we\u2019re responsible for, that we deal to and that is external affairs, that is foreign affairs.  \n   That\u2019s what the constitution invests in the federal government.  \n   So I think honouring the constitution sits alongside the federalist tradition of certainly our party and this is a very important affirmation of that. I remember \u2013 I said this in my maiden speech in the parliament \u2013 you know, states are responsible for some things, federal governments are responsible for others and the best way to get along is for everyone to do their job and to do it as well as possible and not try and do others\u2019 jobs and that\u2019s what is certainly the way I\u2019ve sought to approach this pandemic and the many other issues that are there.  \n   We all just need to do our jobs and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re doing and, in many cases, those jobs combined, as we\u2019ve seen around aged care \u2013 we have very clear responsibilities in relation to aged care, and the state governments have very clear responsibilities for public health, and in a pandemic, they come together and they overlap, so you have to work together. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.38am BST \n \n \n  1.32am BST  \n  \n  There has been some discussion in New Zealand that the Australian terrorist who killed 51 people peacefully praying at two Christchurch mosques last year should serve his sentence in Australia. \n  I will not name him. You know who he is and what he did. \n  His sentencing is under way \u2013 if you can, please read the testimony of the families and loved ones whose lives were forever altered by his evil, who stand as shining examples of who we should all strive to be in the face of such human horror. \n  Morrison: \n   \n   This is not a matter which the prime minister Ardern has raised with me.  \n   It\u2019s normal practice that criminals convicted of these offences serve their sentences in that jurisdiction, and that\u2019s my understanding of what the arrangements are and no request has been made to Australia for that to be any different.  \n   And I remember these events, as we all do, terribly and, once again, as New Zealanders in particular are brought to remembrance of that just unthinkable day, my heart goes out to them and it brings it all back, even as we stand here, it\u2019s bringing it back for me.  \n   And Jenny and I were incredibly touched by meeting the survivors of that attack, and the incredible grace that they showed afterwards was astounding, and inspiring and so, to all those affected by that, including the Muslim community here in Australia, for whom it\u2019s brought remembrance, still thinking, still thinking of you.  \n   Now, on the other matter, there is only one sovereignty in Australia and it\u2019s Australia: I mean we\u2019re a sovereign Australians. We are all Australians and that\u2019s where our sovereignty rests and that\u2019s how I would respond. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.35am BST \n \n \n  1.26am BST  \n  \n  It\u2019s clear that the federal government\u2019s concern over Victoria\u2019s Belt and Road agreement is one of the major factors behind this announcement, even though Scott Morrison says he doesn\u2019t want to prejudice the process by weighing in on any particular deal. \n  The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, argued her department had \u201cdeep and broad expertise to assess whether arrangements with foreign governments are in the national interest\u201d. \n  \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have a process of consultation, the commonwealth has no opportunity to review the proposed arrangements, nor to apply that expertise. We risk having an uncoordinated patchwork approach to contracts or MoUs or relationships and collaborations that could have an adverse effect on our foreign policy.\u201d \n  It\u2019s certainly true that the Victorian belt and road agreement has attracted concern in Australia\u2019s national security establishment \u2013 and the scheme more generally has attracted strong pushback from the US government.But it\u2019s previously been reported that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not explicitly warn Victoria against such cooperation. \n  The Australian reported in May this year that senior Dfat officials had told the state government in May 2018 that its plans did not undercut federal government policy, and had also provided written feedback in June 2018. \n  The newspaper reported - based on Victorian government notes of a meeting with Dfat officials \u2013 that the then head of Dfat\u2019s north-east Asia branch said: \u201cThere is merit from the relationship that you are proposing through the BRI.\u201d  \n  Dfat responded to that account by saying it had also urged Victoria to exercise \u201ccaution\u201d to \u201cconsider the broader national interest\u201d, the Australian reported. \n  \n Updated at 1.36am BST \n \n \n  1.25am BST  \n  \n  On belt and road initiatives, Scott Morrison says: \n   \n   It\u2019s important that, when you act in accordance with powers that are yet to be established, that you do not prejudice decisions and so I\u2019m not going to say anything here and the Foreign Affairs Minister wouldn\u2019t be saying anything here that could potentially prejudice any decisions that we might make after properly reviewing any agreements that are currently in place, because if we were to take decisions that were to cancel those, they should be done according to the proper process set up under the legislation so it would be irresponsible of me or the Foreign Affairs Minister, I think, to go into the specifics of any one agreement at this point.  \n   There\u2019s been plenty of commentary on the ones that you referred to.  \n   There\u2019s plenty of commentary on that. And matters have been raised directly with premiers where that\u2019s been necessary, but we will act in accordance with powers established by the and my job right now is to get the support of these powers through the Parliament and then we\u2019ll deal with individual instances.  \n   \n  And does Scott Morrison want a border appeal process put in place: \n   \n   In relation to how any sort of a proper appeal mechanism works, well, in some states they do have them and what I\u2019d be seeking is a harmonisation and a consistency in how states apply those.  \n   They\u2019re not federal borders. They are state borders, for states to administer, and they need to do so in a way which minimises the pain and the hardship and the inconvenience that is not necessary and that Australians, wherever they live, have the appropriate review mechanisms in place for any administrative decision that can impact on them and their livelihoods and, indeed, their health. \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.23am BST  \n  \n  Will the federal government move to cancel state agreements with foreign powers? \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n   I\u2019m not going to prejudice the outcome of any decisions the minister for foreign affairs might make. It\u2019s important that, a) the legislation is passed \u2013 I wrote to premiers yesterday. I had already flagged with premiers and chief ministers at the national security briefing they had some weeks ago that we would have more to say in this area and flagged that they would be getting advice along these lines, and provided that to them yesterday and once the legislation has been through the party room, we\u2019ll share that with the states and territories and work through that.  \n   Any individual arrange the, it\u2019s a clear test \u2013 if they\u2019re inconsistent with federal foreign affairs policy, they\u2019ll go. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.25am BST \n \n \n  1.21am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison continues that answer: \n   \n   I\u2019ll have more to say about this tomorrow at the bush summit, at Cooma, not far from here, but it is important that we continue to remove barriers where they\u2019re not necessary, and where there are barriers, we have the most sensible, practical and time-limited arrangements and people know when they can come off so they can get on with their lives.  \n   That\u2019s always been my very strong view. National cabinet has never made one decision that supports the unilateral imposition of borders within Australia.  \n   There is no resolution of national cabinet to that end, where states have made those decisions.  \n   They\u2019ve made them either, as I\u2019ve said, with the commonwealth in the case of the Victoria and New South Wales border, or they\u2019ve made them unilaterally on their own behalf and they are the ones who have to explain how that works and how it is administered. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.24am BST \n \n \n  1.20am BST  \n  \n  Will Scott Morrison attempt to legislate to stop border closures where they are deemed not to be necessary: \n   \n   In relation to the border arrangements that have been put in place at a state level, as I said yesterday and I\u2019ve said many times, Australia wasn\u2019t built to have internal borders.  \n   Having internal borders in Australia is an extreme response, which can be necessary in extreme circumstances and based on a proper medical advice and a very transparent process for doing that \u2013 and we saw in relation to the New South Wales-Victorian border \u2013 what occurred there was cooperation between the neighbouring states and, indeed, the commonwealth, the appointment of a border commissioner to try and resolve the many heart-breaking examples that we continue to work through today, and, you know, when borders get put up within a country like Australia, it is very difficult to try and avoid the sort of circumstances we\u2019ve seen occur, very, very difficult to do that.  \n   Obviously, when it comes to that particular border, and the very extreme situation we\u2019ve seen in Melbourne, that it was agreed amongst both premiers and myself, that that was a necessary action and one that I hope is one that won\u2019t have to remain, hopefully, for much longer, and particularly as the situation in regional Victoria confirms itself, hopefully it won\u2019t be needed much longer.  \n   But I am confident that in the relationship and the way we\u2019re working together within the federation between New South Wales, Victoria and the commonwealth \u2013 and those matters, I think, can be properly resolved.  \n   I\u2019ve had similar discussions with the Western Australian premier about how those arrangements can best operate. The constitutional issues around this are not as clear-cut as the constitutional issues when it comes to the commonwealth\u2019s foreign affairs powers.  \n   I think they\u2019re very clear. So I think we\u2019re talking about a different area of grey and, you know, the national cabinet has achieve many great things over these last six months and I can understand that Australians are frustrated that the border issues through that process are not being addressed as well as we\u2019d hope.  \n   That has not been, through any lack of effort, I can assure you, on the federal government\u2019s part, but it does demonstrate that the constitutional powers that sit around internal borders are vague when it comes to dealing with specific circumstances. It\u2019s all about proportionality. \n   And when you\u2019re looking at a border between Victoria and New South Wales, that\u2019s one set of circumstances. In other places, it\u2019s different. I will continue to work to ensure we have a transparent and fair process, that there are appropriate appeal rights in place, for people who are affected by these decisions. It affects their lives. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.22am BST \n \n \n  1.18am BST  \n  \n  OK, so that bill is very important and long overdue and we should have a stronger recycling sector in this country and we all should think about where our waste is going. \n  But this came to ahead because our south-east Asian neighbours started sending our rubbish back. \n  They were no longer taking it.  \n  That\u2019s what caused this to come to ahead.  \n  \n Updated at 1.19am BST \n \n \n  1.16am BST  \n  \n  Following the thank you, Scott Morrison moves to a new recycling and waste reduction bill: \n   \n   The recycling and waste reduction bill will phase in the end of 645,000 tonnes of processed plastic, paper, glass and tyres that Australia ships overseas every year.  \n   The bill will implement the export ban on waste, plastic, paper, glass and ties agreed by the then Coag in March of this year, one of the final agreements in Coag. At the same time, the reforms to the regulation of product stewardship will incentivise companies to take greater environmental responsibility for the products they manufacture and what happens to those products and materials at the end of their life. \n   The bill complements the recycling modernisation fund and national waste policy action plan, which will create 10,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. That\u2019s a 32% increase in jobs in the Australian waste and recycling seconder and these reforms will drive a billion-dollar transformation of Australia\u2019s waste and recycling capacity. It\u2019s our waste.  \n   It\u2019s our responsibility. We\u2019ve got to deal with it and recycle it and repurpose it and reuse it here to both drive drive jobs in the recycling and improve the quality of our environment.  \n   This is a key issue I\u2019ve been raising, not just in the Pacific Islands Forum \u2013 and I only just spoke this morning to the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, but it has also been an issue that I\u2019ve been raising in the East Asian Summit and with our Asean friends and colleagues where waste plastics in oceans is destroying communities, it is destroying their livelihoods, it is destroying their health and this was a pledge that I said we would honour and follow through on and I think this is a great day for demonstrating Australia\u2019s leadership when it comes to an export ban on these waste products.  \n   When I talk to kids in schools, that\u2019s what they talk to me about, they talk to me about those plastic bottles and the things in the oceans \u2013 whether it\u2019s their rivers and oceans and streams, or those floating around in the Pacific or around the seas of south-east Asia and so I\u2019m very pleased that the they\u2019re introducing that bill today, as the minister for foreign affairs is also. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.19am BST \n \n \n  1.12am BST  \n  \n  This was the motion Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen tried to move against Craig Kelly\u2019s  hydroxychloroquine conspiracy theories which he has been floating in parliament, and on his MP social media, (which have been endorsed by Pete Evans), which the government shut down: \n  I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014That the House:1) notes that:a) on 25 August 2020, the member for Hughes gave a speech in the federation chamber supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19;b) in his speech, the member said that \u201cmedia bias\u201d, \u201cgroupthink\u201d and the \u201ccomplete abandonment of reason\u201d were driving a \u201cwar\u201d on hydroxychloroquine and \u201cthe big hand of government \u2026 interfer[ing] in a doctor-patient relationship\u201d, and cited a number of medical commentators including:i) Professor Christian Perronne, who is being investigated by the French College of Physicians for his comments on hydroxychloroquine;ii) Dr Harvey Risch, who was rebuked by 25 Yale University colleagues for promoting \u201cconspiracy theories, purported hoaxes, and the views of zealots\u201d; and iii) Dr Kulvinder Gill, who was criticised by other Canadian doctors for misleading tweets on hydroxychloroquine;c) in Australia, potential therapies are assessed for safety and efficacy by the independent Therapeutic Goods Administration, and the TGA \u201cstrongly discourages the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 \u2026 or prevent COVID-19\u201d; andd) the National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce, comprised of 29 peak health bodies, has also advised that \u201chydroxychloroquine is potentially harmful and no more effective than standard care\u201d;2) affirms that it is the responsibility of all public officeholders to acknowledge and support the independence and expertise of the TGA and counter misinformation and conspiracy theories. \n  \n Updated at 1.14am BST \n \n \n  1.08am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews and prevention of family violence minister Gabrielle Williams will be up at 11am. \n  \n Updated at 1.12am BST \n \n \n  1.05am BST  \n Scott Morrison press conference \n  \n  The prime minister seems a little puffed as he begins this press conference. \n  It is colder than my heart in Canberra today. And the morning has been pretty full-on for everyone in the building, so I get it. \n  He starts the press conference which has been called to talk about the proposed foreign investment veto with a thank you: \n   \n   Can I start today, before moving to the reason for today\u2019s press conference \u2013 and I\u2019m joined by the minister for foreign affairs \u2013 to thank Australians, whether they be in the hotspot of Melbourne or they be in regional parts of the country where they\u2019re dealing with the incredible frustration of border restrictions, can I thank the small businesses of this country, the large businesses of this country, keeping people in work.  \n   This has been a very difficult time, a very frustrating time, a very anxious time.  \n   And Australians have just kept their determination up, their positivity, wherever they can.  \n   And I want to thank tell, just simply thank them and ask them to continue to demonstrate the goodwill and the good faith they have, despite the frustrations and the limitations and the anxieties that they have to cope with every day.  \n   As we gather here in this parliament, under different circumstances to usual \u2013 the circumstances faced by many Australians, particularly in Victoria and in those border regions \u2013 is something quite different and I just want Australians to know that we get that. And we know that. And we very much appreciate what you are doing each and every day.  \n   I welcome the fact that we\u2019ve seen again the continuation of lower numbers than we have seen in Victoria \u2013 nowhere near what we\u2019d like them to be and the fatalities we continue to see are devastating and particularly for the families directly involved \u2013 and, of course, we know that we will continue to see that for some time yet as the impacts of the community transmission, as it\u2019s worked it\u2019s way through the Victorian community, will continue to have those impacts.  \n   But that said, Victoria has turned the corner and we will continue to invest our efforts in assisting them to ensure that we can continue to get this outbreak under control and return life in Melbourne and across Victoria, to as normal as you can in a Covid-safe world, as soon as we can and working with the state and territories to ensure that other restrictions, wherever they can be reinformed, can be removed as soon as possible.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.08am BST \n \n \n  12.59am BST  \n  \n  Over in the House of Representatives, Chris Bowen has tried to suspend standing orders to talk about Craig Kelly\u2019s continual vocal support of hydroxychloroquine, which the national health expert committee advising the government has advised against as a Covid treatment, on his social media - and the parliament - but was gagged by the government. \n  Kelly thinks the response to hydroxychloroquine, which experts have told us is no more effective in treating Covid, but can have dire consequences for patients, is because of \u201cmedia group think\u201d. \n  Kelly\u2019s preselection was saved by Malcolm Turnbull, and then Scott Morrison \u2013 both of whom made personal interventions when his branch wanted to dump him. \n  \n Updated at 1.06am BST \n \n \n  12.55am BST  \n Penny Wong says aged care minister 'has to go' \n  \n  Penny Wong finishes with: \n   \n   The fact is, Senator Richard Colbeck has lost the confidence of the Parliament.  \n   He has lost the confidence of the public. And he has to go. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.59am BST \n \n \n  12.54am BST  \n  \n  Penny Wong is also finishing up her reply. She repeats her comments from late yesterday: \n   \n   When we look at Senator Colbeck\u2019s performance in the Senate. When we look at his performance in the Senate Select Committee. When we look at his performance as a minister - that is the question. \n   Would you trust your parents, your grandparents, your aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters wives or husbands to Senator Colbeck\u2019s care? \n   Well, if not, why would you expect other Australians to trust their loved ones to his care? \n   And why would you accept a prime minister forcing Australian\u2019s support for their elderly loved ones in Senator Colbeck\u2019s care. It is that simple.  \n   And if you wouldn\u2019t want him to be in charge of the care of your loved one, why do you expect others to. \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.51am BST  \n  \n  Richard Colbeck then leaves the Senate, as Penny Wong gets to her feet to respond.  \n  Wong asks him to stay.

She has asked, I\u2019ve called many Labor MPs in Victoria, to give them information on outbreaks that are occurring in their electorates, so they can assist their constituents, with their issues.  \n   I\u2019ve worked closely with my counterpart in Victoria cooperating on many of the issues in the interest of senior Australians in Victoria and their loved ones and I acknowledge and thank him for his cooperation, responding to this cruel virus and its impact on communities remains my focus.  \n   And again, my sincerest condolences to all of those who have lost loved ones.  \n   Mr president, We are all ultimately responsible for the decisions made to protect the people we love the most.  \n   That is my focus to deliver the plan to keep senior Australians safe. I thank the Senate.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.55am BST \n \n \n  12.47am BST  \n Aged care minister Richard Colbeck defends record during pandemic \n  \n  Richard Colbeck is detailing his response during the pandemic, and defending his record. \n  He is about to finish his speech, and said this: \n   \n   We have been there every step of the way. Every day. We have not stopped, planning, adapting and implementing.  \n   Mr President, I met a couple of weeks ago with a friend who I hadn\u2019t seen for 30 years. She came to talk to me about the death of her mother, four years ago. And her concerns about the loss of dignity her mum felt in a residential aged care facility.  \n   I sat with her while she cried because she hadn\u2019t been able to address that issue for four years.  \n   She came into my office we sat and we talked, and we worked our way through what could be done, what will be done, and try and I tried to help her with her pain.  \n   And Mr President, it\u2019s those sorts of stories, and those that we heard from the royal commission that drive me that drive the government to improve the residential aged care sector in this country.  \n   \n  As someone who has watched someone they love go through what Colbeck\u2019s friend was describing \u2013 the loss of dignity \u2013 I understand what he is saying. But the Coalition was in power four years ago. It had been in government for almost a term since then. These problems are not new. The pandemic has laid bare problems we all knew existed.  \n  \n Updated at 12.58am BST \n \n \n  12.26am BST  \n  \n  The last parliament sitting for the week is about to start. \n  \n Updated at 12.39am BST \n \n \n  12.24am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 10am to talk about the proposed foreign veto powers. \n  \n Updated at 12.39am BST \n \n \n  12.20am BST  \n Aged care minister to provide 'explanation of his administration of his portfolio' to Senate \n  \n  Richard Colbeck has been ordered by the Senate to front up and explain his administration of the aged care portfolio during the pandemic. \n  That will happen at 9.30am. \n  Penny Wong will seek to reply after Colbeck delivers his statement. \n  It might be worth remembering this is what Wong said about the aged care minister yesterday, while speaking to the ABC (it was not in response to a question, she asked to make a comment at the end of her interview segment so she could get it in). \n  Wong:  \n   \n   Can I just say something quickly about Richard Colbeck? You know, I sit in the Senate every day with this bloke, and I tell you, Patricia, I would not trust the care of my parents to him. \n   \n  Patricia Karvelas: That\u2019s a really strong point to make... You wouldn\u2019t trust the care of your own parents with Richard Colbeck, why not? \n  Wong:  \n   \n   I genuinely do not believe this man understands what it is to be a responsible minister in the portfolio. \n   I do not believe he is competent. \n   I think, you know, we watch him in the Senate, talking about process and webinars and letters and talking, in circumstances where it is clear he has been warned by their own taskforce, by their own royal commission, and by the events in Australia in the sector itself this year. \n   I mean to suggest that the workforce, they didn\u2019t plan for a withdrawal of the workforce, when we saw what happened in Newmarch House, is extraordinary. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.23am BST \n \n \n  12.16am BST  \n  \n  Chris Bowen was asked about the government\u2019s foreign investment veto bill while talking to Sky this morning. \n  It doesn\u2019t seem like Labor had any advance warning this was coming. The responses are by rote: \n   \n   Well, I mean, if the government would like to show us the bill, we\u2019ll work through it. But on the matter, in the substance of the matter, of course, governments have to work together to ensure our national sovereignty.  \n   Minister Payne actually welcomed the Victorian MOU on the belt and road initiative when it was signed.  \n   So did Minister Birmingham so they\u2019ve changed their tune quite considerably. Fair enough, circumstances change. But if circumstances do change, I think it would be good for the Federal Government to sit down in good faith with the Victorian Government and work the issues through. It is not unusual for states to engage in ensuring that their interests around the world are furthered.  \n   I mean, states have representatives around the world. States have had agents in London for decades, and states have representatives I know in various cities in China and Indonesia, pursuing trade deals on behalf of the states.  \n   Now, yes, foreign policy must be the responsibility of the commonwealth, if the Commonwealth has any concern about any agreements, and I heard Minister Payne say there is 135 I think she said such agreements.  \n   Then they have a right to ensure that they\u2019re consistent, but that\u2019s best done working with the state governments. And I do know also, while we\u2019re on the topic that the federal government does have an arrangement under the Belt and Road initiative that former Minister Ciobo signed, which they still haven\u2019t released.  \n   So if we want to be, you know, trying to ensure transparency, maybe the federal government could get their own house in order first, and release that document so that we could see what\u2019s in involved in that.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.20am BST \n \n \n  12.11am BST  \n  \n  Queensland Health has completed its genome testing of the virus infection which sparked the most recent cluster, but can\u2019t find any definitive link with the virus infection one of the women who returned from Melbourne and allegedly lied on her border declaration.

He has worked for the airline for the past decade, along with his wife and son. \n  He\u2019s lost his job and the interview was just heartbreaking. This is happening all around the country at the moment and it never gets easier hearing it.  \n   \n   Scott Morrison, who, I mean, I\u2019m in his federal electorate, \u2018cause I\u2019m one of your constituents, you should try and help all people that this has occurred to, help them out.

If we\u2019ve got jobkeeper happening until March 31, March 2021, then we should at least have Qantas keep us on until 2021.  \n   And see what happens. But like I said, I mean, I\u2019m in Scott Morrison\u2019s electorate, so help me out, mate. I\u2019ve got a mortgage. I\u2019ve got a wife and a kid that has already been pushed out. And I don\u2019t know what to do after this. I\u2019m 55 years old and I\u2019ve tried to grab jobs. And nobody\u2019s hiring me.

He wants action. \n  (David Littleproud said this inquiry would be different to the other inquiries because ... reasons.)  \n  Fitzgibbon: Australia\u2019s struggling dairy farmers face yet another inquiry. They needed help, not more talk, a long time ago. \n  In April 2018, the ACCC produced a report to government after an exhaustive 18-month-long inquiry into the Australia\u2019s dairy industry. The Morrison government has now announced yet another inquiry while a Senate committee inquiry is still in progress.Dairy farmers have made it clear to the committee that they need help now and will be disappointed that the Morrison government has announced another inquiry.Queensland dairy farmer, Mr Trace made it clear to the committee that dairy farmers are desperate for real action to fix the farmgate milk price, stating that:\u201cWe need to get the farmgate milk price up so that we can sustain the industry. That\u2019s what we need. It could be solved in a day with the right people in a room. We need the political will to do it, and that\u2019s what the farmers are doubting.\u201dThe treasurer says the ACCC will:\u2026 undertake an inquiry into harmful imbalances of bargaining power between farmers, intermediaries, including processors, and retailers in the domestic supply chains of perishable agricultural goods in Australia.In its 2018 report the ACCC concluded:\u2026 farmers\u2019 lack of bargaining power means that they are unlikely to benefit from an increase in the retail (or wholesale) prices of private label milk or other dairy products. Even if processors were to receive higher wholesale prices from sales to supermarkets, this does not mean the processors will pay farmers any more than they must secure milk. Farmers\u2019 ability to capture their appropriate share of profit.The ACCC identified the obvious; farmers don\u2019t have any relationship with Coles, Woolworths, or any other retailer. They deal only with the processors and there is a clear market power imbalance between the two.If the Government is saying the ACCC was wrong, it should make that clear and invite it to re-visit this issue. The Treasurer also says: \u2026 the ACCC will also examine the effectiveness of the new Dairy Code of Conduct including by considering options to extend the code across the entire domestic dairy supply chain.So, the government is already questioning its own Code of Conduct, its only meaningful response to the last ACCC inquiry. And it\u2019s doing so even though the ACCC report said there is no relationship between farmers and retailers.If the government is serious about finally helping our struggling dairy farmers, it will extend the terms of reference for the latest inquiry to include an investigation of the merits of a mandatory minimum farmgate milk price in each dairy region. \n  \n Updated at 11.12pm BST \n \n \n  10.41pm BST  \n  \n  Tanya Plibersek was also asked about the proposed foreign investment veto plan, in relation to how it would impact universities. \n  She told the ABC: \n   \n   I think it is important that, where it\u2019s beneficial for Australia, we cooperate with other nations.  \n   We have some great discoveries that way. We get some really super-smart people to come and work in Australia and pass on their knowledge to Australians that work with them.  \n   That sort of academic cooperation is something that we should value. We need to be careful that, when it\u2019s happening, if there are things that are discovered or invented, that, for example, have military application, that that transfer of knowledge is handled very carefully or, you know, protected here within Australia.  \n   We need to be careful about intellectual property, to make sure that patents lodged benefit Australia, that we capture the value of that discovery and of that inventiveness here in Australia. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.44pm BST \n \n \n  10.39pm BST  \n Sydney gyms and hospital cafe on coronavirus alert \n  \n  AAP has some information on NSW\u2019s latest health alerts: \n  A Covid-19 health alert has been issued for anyone who recently attended a dance class at an inner Sydney gym after a third person who visited another CBD gym was diagnosed with coronavirus. \n  NSW Health said anyone who attended the City Tattersalls gym between 8am to 2pm on August 19, 21 or 23 should get tested for COVID-19 and isolate at home for 14 days.  \n  Other members of City Tattersalls should get tested if they have even the mildest symptoms. \n  One of the gym-goers went to the ground-floor Windscreens Cafe at Randwick\u2019s Royal hospital for Women on Tuesday morning and authorities are trying to trace anyone who might be have been a close contact. \n  NSW Health also says anyone who attended a 7.40pm dance class at Virgin Gym at Zetland in the inner east on Monday should get tested and isolate at home for 14 days. \n  Anyone else who attended the gym from 7.30-10pm on Monday should monitor for symptoms and get tested if they appear. \n  Meanwhile, a trainee bus driver worked for three days between August 20-24 while infectious on routes in Blacktown, Rouse Hill, and Mt Druitt. \n  Meanwhile, Riverstone High School, Wyndham College, both in Sydney\u2019s north-west, and Schofields Public School in the west, were closed on Wednesday while coronavirus tests for students were processed. \n  NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said one year 12 student had returned a positive result and would be included in Thursday\u2019s case numbers. \n  Another student had an \u201cequivocal\u201d result and will be tested again, while two other students returned negative results but would be retested as an extra precaution. \n  \n Updated at 2.16am BST \n \n \n  10.38pm BST  \n  \n  And what does Steven Marshall think of the government\u2019s proposed foreign investment veto powers for states? \n   \n   Look, we certainly will look at the detail of what is provided. The prime minister has raised this at the national cabinet. I think the agreement that we have is with the Shandong province and it\u2019s an agreement that goes back 30 years.  \n   We certainly haven\u2019t contemplated a belt and road initiative here between the Chinese government and South Australia, but we do have a good working relationship with China.  \n   We\u2019ve got excellent exports. We got excellent investment coming into South Australia. International students. We want to maintain good relationships with China. We think this is really important. We understand where the prime minister is going on this. We\u2019ll be supportive.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.40pm BST \n \n \n  10.37pm BST  \n  \n  South Australian premier Steven Marshall had a chat to the ABC this morning, where he spoke about when the state could open its borders to everyone: \n   \n   There\u2019s no forward-plan that we can see what\u2019s going to happen in different jurisdictions in two, three, four months\u2019 time. So we got to respond to keep our population safe.  \n   But I think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. In South Australia, we have opened our borders to Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania.  \n   We\u2019re looking very closely at the ACT and also New South Wales at the moment.

The last election in that state was dominated by what would happen with the Adani coalmine. \n  That has calmed down in the last couple of years, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the protests have stopped. \n  Adani has announced it has launched civil proceedings against one of the activists protesting against its Queensland operations \u201cto protect our rights, as well as those of our employees and contractors, to carry out legal and legitimate business activities free from intimidation and harassment\u201d. \n  It has released a statement saying it has filed a civil damages claim in the Queensland supreme court: \n   \n   This legal action does not seek to limit free speech. As we have repeatedly stated, we believe a diversity of views is an important part of democracy. \n   The civil legal action seeks to limit the campaign of alleged harassment and intimidation orchestrated by [the activist] against our business that aims to prevent us from legally and legitimately pursuing our commercial interests. \n   \n  I haven\u2019t named the activist as I haven\u2019t had a chance to read yet through the court documents as it is still before sparrows, but we will keep you updated. \n  \n Updated at 10.28pm BST \n \n \n  10.24pm BST  \n  \n  The attorney general, Christian Porter, will introduce legislation to create a new office of the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention. \n  The national commissioner will have powers broadly equivalent to a royal commission, with a permanent role to monitor the implementation of its own recommendations to ensure long-term solutions are delivered. \n  Porter said: \n   \n   As the prime minister said when he first announced this important initiative, this is about being continually vigilant when it comes to the care and wellbeing of our veterans, as well as those serving men and women who protect our community and our freedoms.\u201cThe national commissioner will be truly independent and deliver genuine transparency as it helps to uncover the root causes and contributing factors in ADF member and veteran deaths by suicide. \n   It will also provide the opportunity for families and those people who have been personally affected by an ADF member or veteran death by suicide to share their story in a safe and supported way. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.28pm BST \n \n \n  10.24pm BST  \n Good morning \n  \n  Well, just hours after China\u2019s deputy mission head of mission in Australia, Wang Xining, admitted there were \u201csome shadows\u201d over the relationship between the two countries, the federal government announced it is seeking new powers to review and stop agreements it judges to impact foreign relations. \n  That means state, territory and local governments (as well as universities) from be prevented or must cease entering arrangements which are considered to be detrimental to Australia\u2019s foreign policy positions. \n  And what would that mean? \n  Well, for starters, Victoria\u2019s belt and road initiative would be one of the first under the microscope. \n  As Murph and Dan Hurst report: \n   \n   A planned stocktake of existing agreements will be broader than Victoria\u2019s politically controversial belt and road agreement, but that deal has been viewed with concern by Australia\u2019s national security establishment and it has also attracted criticism from the United States. \n   The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, used an interview in May to leave open the possibility of suspending some forms of information sharing with Australia if the Victorian deal resulted in projects that affected the safety of security networks. \n   Within hours the US ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse Jr, clarified that the US had \u201cabsolute confidence in the Australian government\u2019s ability to protect the security of its telecommunications networks and those of its Five Eyes partners\u201d and Pompeo was simply answering questions about \u201cvery remote\u201d hypotheticals. \n   \n  Closer to home, that most likely means another constitutional fight will be hashed out in the high court.  \n  The federal government claimed intergovernmental immunity to stop officials from appearing at the NSW Ruby Princess special inquiry.  \n  But is now flipping that to say it has powers to cancel agreements made by other jurisdictions. Can\u2019t say the states will be too happy with that. \n  But the federal government does have responsibility over foreign affairs. So it will be a pretty big grey zone the high court will be asked to colour in one way or the other. It won\u2019t be quick, or easy, so pay attention to what comes next. \n  Australia\u2019s increasingly tense relationship with the CCP is one of the issues which has been bubbling away under the surface during the pandemic, but aged care remains the focus domestically. \n  Anthony Albanese will address the National Press Club today, with a speech titled \u201cGovernment by neglect\u201d. The aged care royal commission\u2019s interim report released in October last year was called \u201cNeglect\u201d,if you were looking for clues over what that was about.  \n  Meanwhile, Victoria is approaching the end of its fourth week with Melbourne under lockdown, and people are looking for some \u201cwhat comes next\u201d hope from premier Daniel Andrews. He is coming up to his 50th straight daily press conference, but in a sign that things look to have turned a corner, there has not been a lot of new Covid announcements in his daily briefings lately, outside the latest data. \n  We don\u2019t know what stage three will look like for Melbourne, but we hope to find out soon. \n  NSW is still worried about low levels of community transmission \u2013 it recorded five mystery cases yesterday, from about 25,000 tests, which is keeping authorities on alert, while Queensland is crossing its fingers it has caught any lingering cases, recording just one positive diagnosis from 20,000 tests \u2013 and that person had been in isolation as a close contact of a known case. \n  We\u2019ll keep you updated on all the political and Covid news as it happens.  \n  You have Amy Remeikis with you for the day. Once I hunt down a coffee, we\u2019ll be right into it. \n  Ready? \n  \n Updated at 10.39pm BST \n", "Australia coronavirus live: NSW reports eight more Covid cases \u2013 as it happened [2020-12-23T08:27:27Z]": " \n  8.10am GMT  \n End-of-day summary \n  \n  And with that, we come to the end of today\u2019s live blog. Here\u2019s what went down today: \n   \n   NSW recorded eight new cases today, from 42,000 tests, with seven of those linked to the northern beaches cluster. Premier Gladys Berejiklian also announced Sydney will stick to a 10-visitor rule for Christmas, but children under 12 will be exempt from the cap. People who live in the northern section of the northern beaches will be allowed five guests to their house between 24 and 26 December, but only if the guests live in this same region; while people in the southern part of northern beaches will be allowed to host 10 visitors over the same Christmas period. \n   7,000 people who had been in NSW were tested in Victoria yesterday, after a single positive case turned up in a returning traveller from NSW. \n   South Australia\u2019s Parafield cluster was declared \u201cclosed\u201d today after the state marked four weeks since the last coronavirus case linked to the outbreak went into quarantine. \n   A Qantas worker tested positive today as well, having returned to Australia on a reparation flight from Paris, before flying on a domestic flight into Sydney from Darwin.  \n   Labor leader Anthony Albanese today called for the government to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, saying the TGA will approve it by January, when he thinks the rollout should begin. But health minister Greg Hunt called the push \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \n   The Australian Medical Association called on the NSW government to cancel the NYE fireworks to \u201cdiscourage crowds and avoid any confusion in its public messaging\u201d. \n   \n  It\u2019s Christmas Eve tomorrow, and hopefully that will continue to bring good news on the northern beaches outbreak.

Fyles said it she was seeking clarity on the case and on whether aircrews are permitted to travel after entering the territory.  \n   \n   In terms of the flight crew, that is an operational matter for Qantas but it is of course upholding the strictest health standards, so I will need to have more information around what this situation is and make sure I have the full facts before I make comment. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.44am GMT \n \n \n  6.18am GMT  \n  \n  The Northern Territory has revoked its categorisation of New South Wales region Illawarra as a coronavirus hotspot. \n  Health minister Natasha Fyles made the announcement this afternoon following an emergency cabinet meeting, saying the decision was made because there were no cases from the northern beaches there. \n   \n   This is based on the evidence that they\u2019ve had no cases from the northern beaches coronavirus cluster. I know people are anxiously awaiting other local government areas, but the advice from our chief health officer Hugh Heggie ... is that it is safe to remove that hotspot declaration for the Illawarra Shire local government area. The others will remain in place. \n   \n  People from the region in quarantine at Howard Springs will be able to leave today. \n  Illawarra, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast and greater metropolitan Sydney were declared hotspots on Sunday, 20 December. \n  \n Updated at 6.27am GMT \n \n \n  6.06am GMT  \n  \n  Victoria is reminding people from greater Sydney, the Central Coast or the northern beaches to not attempt to enter Victoria, just in case you might have forgotten.  \n   \n   \n    If you have been in Greater Sydney, the Central Coast, or Sydney's Northern Beaches since Dec 11 please do not attempt to enter Victoria.

The reality is the virus and the pandemic are far from over, and the virus still poses a risk to the Canberra community. \n   We\u2019ve been through this earlier this year and, once again, Canberrans are responding incredibly well to health directions that we\u2019ve put in place. \n   \n  The current restrictions mean all travellers who have been in Sydney, the Central Coast, the Blue Mountains or Wollongong must isolate themselves for 14 days if they enter the ACT. \n  \n Updated at 5.57am GMT \n \n \n  5.37am GMT  \n Greg Hunt labels Albanese's push for faster vaccine rollout 'irresponsible' \n  \n  Health minister Greg Hunt has criticised opposition leader Anthony Albanese for pushing for a faster vaccine rollout. \n  Hunt said the government will work to ensure the \u201csafety, delivery and proper assessment\u201d of the vaccine isn\u2019t \u201ccompromised\u201d. \n   \n   The single greatest risk to the vaccine program is any concern that the vaccines have been rushed for political reasons. Yet that is exactly the deeply concerning and irresponsible path Mr Albanese has chosen. We will, by contrast, continue to follow the advice of the best medical experts and regulators in the world. \n   \n  Hunt says the government will be sticking to its guns, reiterating the Therapeutic Goods Administration won\u2019t be rushed, and that the vaccine is on course to be made available by early 2021. \n  Hunt goes on to point out that other countries that have begun vaccinating against the virus have only done so in a very limited capacity, under emergency use authorisations.  \n  It comes after Albanese called for the vaccine rollout to be brought forward in light of the outbreak on the northern beaches in Sydney. \n  \n Updated at 5.51am GMT \n \n \n  5.20am GMT  \n  \n  Stranded Australians are pleading for help after Singapore and Hong Kong banned flights from the UK due to the new strain of Covid-19 spreading there.  \n  Australia\u2019s high commission in the UK said on its Facebook page it was working to find alternatives routes home for \u201ca significant number\u201d of stranded Australians in the UK.  \n   \n   We are absolutely aware of the disruption these measures have caused, and we understand the significant numbers of people it has impacted \u2014 our team will be providing support. \n   \n  Foreign minister Marise Payne also released a statement addressing the issue, saying the government will consider \u201cfurther facilitated flights\u201d for the stranded Australians.  \n   \n   Our global diplomatic network is assisting Australians who have been affected by flight restrictions put in place by Singapore and Hong Kong in response to the new Covid-19 strain in the United Kingdom.

A second search on Tuesday resulted in four terror charges being laid against the man. \n   He\u2019s due to face Perth magistrates court on Wednesday. \n   It\u2019s alleged he was intending to incite politically motivated acts in a foreign country. \n   WA\u2019s counter terrorism and emergency response commander Pryce Scanlan called for vigilance around online content advocating for terrorist acts. \n   \u201cWe have seen the devastating impacts that such online radicalisation and incitement can result in,\u201d he said. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.58am GMT \n \n \n  4.49am GMT  \n  \n  Qantas medical director Dr Ian Hosegood has released a statement on the cabin crew member who tested positive, saying Qantas is working with authorities to work out how he contracted the virus. \n   \n   He travelled as a passenger on a domestic flight from Darwin back to Sydney on Friday and has been in self-isolation at home since. This was in line with government approved protocols. Since then the protocols have changed and operating crew won\u2019t be travelling on normal domestic flights after operating international repatriation flights. \n   \n  Hosegood said the crew member didn\u2019t have symptoms when operating the repatriation flight from Paris, or when travelling domestic, and was wearing a mask on both flights.  \n  He also said Qantas was also not aware of any compliance breach to the safety protocols for airline crews in France. \n  The crew member worked on the QF176 Paris-Darwin repatriation flight, before flying to Sydney on Friday and isolating at home, where he developed symptoms.  \n  Authorities are racing to work out how he caught the virus, and where.  \n  \n Updated at 5.01am GMT \n \n \n  4.39am GMT  \n  \n  The ACT has reported another day of zero new cases in the past 24 hours, with only one active case in the capital.  \n  \n \n \n  4.33am GMT  \n  \n  The UK is having a difficult lead up to Christmas, and I think it is probably best encapsulated by this footage:  \n   \n   \n    Oh my god pic.twitter.com/NrZM9UOxnu\u2014 Jamie Dickinson (@jamielewis016) December 22, 2020\n    \n   \n  The footage is of lorry\u2019s parked at Dover, waiting for the border with France to open.  \n  The Department for Transport in the UK has announced the border will reopen to those who\u2019ve tested negative, sparking a mass testing program for the drivers. \n  You can read more on the story here:  \n   \n    Related: France agrees to reopen UK border to lorry drivers with negative Covid test  \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.37am GMT \n \n \n  4.18am GMT  \n  \n  The number of Covid infections in Antartica has risen to 58, after a Chilean base reported 36 cases yesterday.  \n  The health minister for the Biobio region in Chile reported 21 new infections involving some aboard a supply vessel that had serviced their Bernardo O\u2019Higgins base between 27 November and 10 December. \n  Another case was reported in Las Estrellas\u2019 village in Antarctica, where civilian personnel who work at Chile\u2019s Lieutenant Rodolfo Marsh Martin Air Force Base live. \n  The continent had, until yesterday, been the only place on Earth that was Covid-free. \n  \n Updated at 4.27am GMT \n \n \n  3.57am GMT  \n Australia's trade surplus drops amid ongoing tensions with China \n  \n  Australia\u2019s trade surplus has dropped heavily due to ongoing trade tensions with China. \n  AAP has the story:  \n   \n   Australia\u2019s trade surplus for goods has dropped to its lowest level in more than two years after China stopped buying a range of exports. \n   \n   \n   The goods trade surplus for November was $1.9bn after exports rose just one per cent, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures published on Wednesday. \n   The surplus was $4.7bn in October. \n   China\u2019s decision to stop buying Australian coal caused a slump of eight per cent, or $254m, in exports of the commodity. \n   The Chinese government has put tariffs on $20bn worth of Australian exports including barley, beef, cotton, seafood, timber and wine. \n   The action follows Australia\u2019s calls for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, believed to have started in the Chinese province of Wuhan. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.06am GMT \n \n \n  3.38am GMT  \n  \n  And in Queensland now, the state has registered one new positive case, acquired overseas and currently in hotel quarantine.  \n   \n   \n    Coronavirus (#COVID19) case update 23/12.

Have a merry eve of Christmas Eve folks. \n  \n \n \n  1.56am GMT  \n  \n  AAP report that there will likely not be any changes to the crowd size of Sunday night\u2019s A-League season opener between Western Sydney Wanderers and Macarthur FC at Bankwest Stadium. \n  Crowds at Sydney\u2019s major stadiums were brought back to 100% seated capacity earlier this month, before the Covid-19 outbreak on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. \n  That rule allowed Bankwest to return its capacity to 30,000.  \n  That has not yet been formally changed, despite a number of restrictions being implemented across greater Sydney. \n  The A-League was yet to receive any information of changes as of Wednesday lunchtime. \n  Even if the capacity was reduced to 50%, it\u2019s understood it would not impact on the expected crowd of about 10,000. \n  Ticket sales have not been paused. \n  \n Updated at 2.12am GMT \n \n \n  1.38am GMT  \n  \n  And a summary of virus news:  \n   \n   NSW recorded eight new cases since 8pm last night.  \n   Seven were \u201cdirectly linked\u201d to the northern beaches cluster, and one was a household contact of a healthcare worker who was diagnosed yesterday. That health worker had transported Covid-positive returned travellers.  \n   \n   \n   However, the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, revealed that that health worker was also linked to the northern beaches cluster. Genomic sequencing showed her strain did not match the patients she transported \u2013 instead, it was related to the northern beaches.  \n   That link as yet is unclear \u2013 so for now, the healthcare worker and her household contact are still unknown cases.  \n   A Qantas worker has tested positive. They returned from overseas, arrived in Darwin and then caught a domestic flight to Sydney on 18 December.  \n   And while all current NSW cases are linked to the northern beaches, there are confirmed cases who live in western Sydney and the central coast.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.16am GMT \n \n \n  1.33am GMT  \n  \n  Here is a mini summary of that information-packed NSW press conference today. \n  Essentially \u2013 restrictions will slightly ease over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day, but then will (mostly) return on 27 December.  \n  For greater Sydney:  \n   \n   Households will still be limited to 10 visitors \u2013 but over Christmas, children under 12 will not be counted in that total \n   From 27 December, children will be counted in the total \n   And that has to be the same 10 people, not different groups of 10 \n   \n  The northern beaches will be split into two zones \u2013 north and south of the Narrabeen bridge.  \n  For the north zone: \n   \n   The lockdown continues and the general stay-at-home order still applies \n   But, over Christmas, a house will be able to have five visitors, as long as they are also from the same northern zone \n   This will stop from 27 December \n   \n  For the south zone: \n   \n   You can have 10 visitors from 24-26 December \n   Residents cannot leave the southern zone of the northern beaches \n   But your visitors can come in from other parts of greater Sydney \n   These relaxations might continue past 27 December \u2013 that decision will be made on Boxing Day \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.17am GMT \n \n \n  1.18am GMT  \n  \n  As my Canberra colleague Paul Karp mentioned in an earlier blog post, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, told the ABC this morning that Australia should be seeking to roll out the Covid vaccine sooner than March, given the government says it may be approved by the drugs regulator by January. \n  I asked the chair of the independent Advisory Committee on Vaccines, Prof Allen Cheng, this morning about Albanese\u2019s comments. The committee will be reviewing the vaccine data along with the drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Cheng told me: \n   \n   Probably the first thing to say is that the March date isn\u2019t cast in stone. \n   In terms of regulation, there are three main issues \u2013 efficacy (does it work?), safety (both known and unknown risks) and quality. The last is actually one of the more difficult issues and actually takes the longest to work through \u2013 are the manufacturing controls adequate at each of the factories in which the vaccine is being produced? Is there the same dose of vaccine in each vial and each batch? What controls are there to make sure nothing else gets in (ie contamination)? How long can the vaccine be stored in the freezer, once taken out of the freezer and once made up? \n   There are also implementation issues \u2013 the distribution chain (obviously a bit more difficult coming from the factories in the northern hemisphere into a southern summer), training of staff who will be giving the vaccine, working out where the distribution points will be, making sure we have the safety systems in place to pick up and assess any side effects. \n   Obviously there are many people actively working on all these questions across all levels of government and we\u2019re building on existing immunisation programs.  \n   But just as a comparison, we distribute roughly 18m doses of flu vaccine between April and August each year, with a known supply schedule and established infrastructure. For a Covid vaccine, we\u2019ll need to administer 40 or 50m doses of a vaccine as quickly as possible, where we will need to give two doses, with an uncertain supply schedule, difficult cold chain requirements, vaccines of different types and using new vaccines where we will want to monitor any side effect that occurs. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.18am GMT \n \n \n  1.04am GMT  \n Confirmed cases in western Sydney and central coast \n  \n  Some further detail from NSW Health on the latest cases today.  \n  At least two people who live outside of the northern beaches have tested positive.  \n  \u201cNSW health is aware of a Covid-19 positive case on the Central Coast, as well as a case from western Sydney who visited Avoca while infectious last weekend.\u201d \n  Sewage testing on the Central Coast has also shown traces of the virus at a treatment plant in Kincumber serving the Gosford area on Monday 21 December. \n  \n Updated at 1.12am GMT \n \n \n  12.52am GMT  \n 35 people from Sydney in hotel quarantine in Victoria \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s Covid testing chief, Jeroen Weimar, says there are now 35 people who were forced into hotel quarantine in Victoria because they flew in from the \u201cred zone\u201d of Sydney without the right permits. \n  Some of those people are returning Victorians. \n  \u201cThat\u2019s 35 people in total who have been detained over the last five days, returning without the appropriate exemptions from the red zone,\u201d he says. \n  \u201cThere were two in the early hours this morning who arrived at the airport from Sydney. \n  \u201cWe are catching people at our end. Every flight is met by the authorised officers.\u201d  \n  \n Updated at 1.00am GMT \n \n \n  12.44am GMT  \n  \n  Chant clarifies again that the person in hotel quarantine, whose strain is currently the closest match to the northern beaches cluster, is not necessarily the source. \n  A reporter just referred to the person as \u201cpatient zero\u201d.  \n  \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear that it may not be at all related to that traveller,\u201d she says.  \n  The person has not left hotel quarantine since they arrived, and no close contacts of them have tested positive. \n  \u201cI\u2019ve been very open that that is one match that we\u2019ve found in the genome sequencing but there are lots of unknowns,\u201d Chant says. \u201cThere may be other people that have come in to the country through whatever means that may have the same strain.\u201d \n  She says that the example of the healthcare worker \u2013 who everybody assumed contracted the virus from patients \u2013 is proof that you cannot assume how the spread works. \n  \n Updated at 12.46am GMT \n \n \n  12.39am GMT  \n  \n  Chant is asked whether the Qantas worker was tested when they arrived in Darwin.  \n  She does not say whether they were, and says further details will come from the Northern Territory health department.  \n  \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with our colleagues in the Northern Territory health department,\u201d she says.  \n   \n   To be clear, in New South Wales ... even though pilots and other flight crew are allowed to isolate, self-isolate in their homes, in New South Wales, they are required to have a swab.  \n   They can only on-fly or move anywhere in an empty plane. The crew need to be transported on an empty plane \u2013 not a domestic plane. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.24am GMT \n \n \n  12.35am GMT  \n  \n  Chant is sharing more information on that health worker who transported travellers.  \n  It really is a surprise that her strain was linked to the northern beaches \u2013 not to the travellers she was transporting.  \n  \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Chant says. \u201cWe would have probably predicted that ... this transport worker acquired it through transporting an infectious patient.  \n  \u201cAnd I think that I said to you at the time \u2013 we\u2019ve got to keep an open mind.\u201d \n  She says this \u201chighlights the fact of how important that genome sequencing is\u201d. \n   \n   We would have been pursuing one line of inquiry and this really narrows the line of inquiry.  \n   The strain in the US returned travellers is very different from this strain [that she has]. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.14am GMT \n \n \n  12.31am GMT  \n  \n  Berejiklian is asked why residents of greater Sydney are allowed to enter the southern part of the northern beaches.  \n  A reporters asks her: \u201cThey could come from all over Sydney, go to someone\u2019s house on the southern part of the northern beaches and then, after Christmas Day, go back to all the other suburbs and potentially be infectious. What\u2019s the logic behind that?\u201d \n  Berejiklian:  \n   \n   Remember there are not hospitality events and other things in the southern zone of the northern beaches. \n   We thought about the logic of this to a large extent and we came to the conclusion that we want to reduce the chance of a venue outside of the northern beaches having a case which then spreads. \n   That\u2019s why we\u2019ve done what we have. We want to keep an open mind but, again, many people may decide not to enter the northern beaches.  \n   Some parts of Sydney, if you look at some of the cases around Turramurra and Erskineville pub and other places, some of those areas are as risky as the southern part of the northern beaches which is why we\u2019ve made this assessment.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.41am GMT \n \n \n  12.26am GMT  \n New Year's Eve decision to be made after Christmas \n  \n  And from the premier\u2019s official press release:  \n   \n   Decisions on New Year\u2019s Eve and upcoming sporting events will be made after this Christmas period.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.27am GMT \n \n \n  12.24am GMT  \n  \n  Health minister Brad Hazzard, who is a northern beaches resident, says that even though restrictions are eased, people should still consider gatherings. \n  He says people over 70, for example, should reconsider. \n  \u201cIt does come down to the individuals in the end to make their own decisions on whether they\u2019re going to have people come into their homes,\u201d he says.  \n  \u201cI would say that anybody who is over the age of about 70, or anyone with other health issues or co-morbidities, should think seriously about whether or not they have people into their homes. \n  \u201cIf they do, try and do it outside in the fresh air, perhaps on a balcony, perhaps outside somewhere, so that you minimise the risks.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  12.23am GMT  \n Qantas worker who tested positive took domestic flight \n  \n  Some more detail on that new announcement of a Qantas worker who has tested positive.  \n  Chant said that he person flew from Darwin to Sydney on 18 December.  \n  The worker \u201creturned from overseas and flown in through Darwin\u201d. \n  \u201cAnd the person has flown on a domestic flight. That was a Qantas flight departing Darwin to Sydney on 18 December.  \n  \u201cThis news has just come through so we don\u2019t have the flight details and any other details, but we wanted to advise you of that.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  12.20am GMT  \n  \n  Chant is now speaking on other sites of potential exposure outside the northern beaches. \n   \n   Covid infection has been confirmed in a person who ate at the Paddington Alimentari and I encourage all diners there from 17 to 19 December to remain in isolation, get tested again if symptoms arise for any and for takeaway customers to get tested should the slightest of symptoms develop. \n   \n  That was previously designated a hotspot yesterday. \n  \n Updated at 12.26am GMT \n \n \n  12.16am GMT  \n Health worker who tested positive linked to northern beaches cluster, not returned travellers \n  \n  Chief health officer Kerry Chant is speaking now.  \n  In a surprising announcement, she says that a new case yesterday, who was a health worker who transported returned travellers, is actually linked to the northern beaches cluster \u2013 not to international travellers. \n  \u201cThis person did not acquire infection through transporting patients on 14 December, in fact genome sequencing shows it is linked to the Avalon cluster. \n  \u201cWe do not know how this is linked to the Avalon cluster.\u201d \n  \u201cSequencing of the virus shows it is linked ... to some particular people within the Avalon cluster and we\u2019re trying to investigate the missing links of how that transmission occurred.\u201d \n  It had been assumed by NSW Health that the woman contracted the disease through work. \n  One new case reported today is the woman\u2019s partner \u2013 who contracted it from her in their household. \n  There has also been a case in a Qantas staff member who returned from overseas and flew in through Darwin. The person also flew on a domestic flight. \n  \n Updated at 12.20am GMT \n \n \n  12.13am GMT  \n  \n   \n   \n    NSW Covid-19 restrictions for December 24, 25 and 26 @GuardianAus pic.twitter.com/2HfZsfEaa8\u2014 Elias Visontay (@EliasVisontay) December 23, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.12am GMT  \n  \n  Berejiklian stresses that these slight relaxations are just for Christmas.  \n  Most of the restrictions will return on 27 December.  \n  For greater Sydney, that means the 10-visitor rule (where children count towards the 10) will continue on 27 December \u2013 it has not lifted.  \n  For the northern zone of the northern beaches, they will return to lockdown on 27 December, with no visitors.  \n  \u201cWhat you have today is what you will have on 27 December,\u201d she says. \n  The southern part of the northern beaches however, could have a long-term easing of restrictions after Boxing Day.  \n  Berejiklian says this will be decided on Boxing Day, depending on what happens in the southern northern beaches. \n  \n Updated at 12.16am GMT \n \n \n  12.09am GMT  \n 10 visitors allowed in southern part of northern beaches for Christmas \n  \n  For the southern part of the northern beaches, \u201cpeople who might live in Manly or Dee Why\u201d, they can have 10 visitors from 24-26 December.  \n  But people cannot leave their area.  \n   \n   You can have other people come in from the region or other parts of greater Sydney. But you can\u2019t leave. We don\u2019t want people from the northern beaches mingling in other parts of Sydney at this stage but you can welcome people in.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.11am GMT \n \n \n  12.06am GMT  \n Lockdown continues in half of northern beaches, but visitor bubbles allowed \n  \n  Berejiklian has announced what is effectively a \u201cbubble\u201d system \u2013 just for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day \u2013 for one half of the northern beaches. \n  For people north of the Narrabeen Bridge and east of the Bahar Temple at Mona Vale roads, \u201cyou are still in lockdown\u201d, she says.  \n  But the one exception is that from 24-26 December, you can have five people into your home but they must be people from within that region. \n  \n Updated at 12.08am GMT \n \n \n  12.03am GMT  \n Sydney to keep 10-visitor rule for Christmas \n  \n  The current restrictions for greater Sydney will stay the same over Christmas \u2013 which is that you can only have 10 visitors to your home.  \n  However, premier Gladys Berejiklian says there is one \u201csmall tweak\u201d, which is children under 12 are not counted.  \n  That applies for December 24, 25 and 26.  \n  \u201cCan I stress, you cannot have different groups of 10 people during the day. It\u2019s one group of 10 and you have to stick that group of 10, plus kids under 12. \n  \u201cBut come 27 December for greater Sydney, we go back to just 10 per household full stop,\u201d Berejiklian says. \n  \u201cEvery other restriction remains in place but for that addition over the Christmas period,\u201d she says. \n  \n Updated at 12.07am GMT \n \n \n  12.01am GMT  \n NSW records eight new cases \n  \n  New South Wales has recorded new cases since 8pm last night, premier Gladys Berejiklian has announced. \n  That was from 42,000 tests, just shy of the record 44,000 yesterday.  \n  Seven of those are directly linked to the northern beaches cluster.  \n  \n Updated at 12.02am GMT \n \n \n  11.59pm GMT  \n  \n  NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and chief health officer Kerry Chant have just walked into parliament, both wearing masks. \n  Reporters are gathered here at the NSW parliament ahead of today\u2019s case announcement. \n  \n Updated at 12.00am GMT \n \n \n  11.55pm GMT  \n  \n  We\u2019re five minutes away from the 11am press conference.  \n  Premier Gladys Berejiklian will be appearing with health minister Brad Hazzard and chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant.  \n  A reminder, yesterday\u2019s new case total was 8, and 15 the day before that, and 30 the day before that.  \n  So far there have not been new cases not linked to the northern beaches cluster \u2013 or not linked to people who transported returned travellers. \n  But there is evidence of spread at sites outside the northern beaches \u2013 for example, at the Rose of Australia pub in Erskineville, an office in the CBD and at a hair salon in Turramurra.  \n  \n Updated at 11.57pm GMT \n \n \n  11.50pm GMT  \n  \n  As we wait for the 11am announcement, all eyes are on NSW, where premier Gladys Berejiklian will decide what will happen to restrictions over Christmas. \n  Currently, the restrictions are in force until midnight tonight, and could be either extended, rolled back or modified. \n  The current restrictions are: \n  Greater Sydney: \n   \n   Household gatherings will be limited to 10 visitors  \n   A cap of 300 people will apply for hospitality venues and places of worship. \n   Singing and chanting and dancing at indoor venues will not be allowed. (Dancefloors excepted for weddings.) \n   People in the greater Sydney area and the Central Coast, Illawarra-Shoalhaven, and Nepean Blue Mountains, are also asked not to visit aged care facilities, unless it is critical. \n   \n  Northern beaches:  \n   \n   All residents or people in short-term accommodation to stay at home. \n   People are also not permitted to enter the northern beaches LGA without a lawful reason. \n   Hospitality venues and function centres will close for the duration of the order, with the exception of takeaway from hospitality venues. Gyms and places of worship will also close. \n   A resident of the northern beaches may not participate in a public gathering involving more than two people, unless for permitted reasons such as attending work. \n   Acceptable reasons for leaving home include: shopping for food and other essential goods and services, travel for work purposes if working from home is not possible, travel to or from a school or educational institution, exercise, medical care, carer\u2019s responsibilities or compassionate needs. \n   Other acceptable reasons for leaving home include accessing childcare, providing care or emergency assistance and to escape a risk of harm. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.53pm GMT \n \n \n  11.44pm GMT  \n  \n  Double-demerit points will come into force in NSW from midnight tonight, lasting until 3 January.  \n  The extra demerits apply to speeding, seatbelt, mobile phone and motorcycle helmet offences, and police are targeting speeding as well as drink, drug, dangerous and distracted driving, AAP report. \n  \n \n \n  11.22pm GMT  \n  \n  Watch this recap of 2020 in video, prepared by my colleague Becca Leaver. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.12pm GMT  \n  \n  Premier Gladys Berejiklian will speak at 11am on the state\u2019s latest cases and any potential changes to restrictions. \n  \n \n \n  11.01pm GMT  \n 7,000 Victorians tested who had visited Sydney \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s testing commander Jeroen Weimar has just told ABC Radio Melbourne that 7,000 people were tested in the state yesterday who had been in greater Sydney or the Central Coast \u2013 all with negative results.  \n  But he also added that he \u201cwould not be surprised\u201d if the family of the 15-year-old girl who contracted the virus in NSW \u2013 Victoria\u2019s current only interstate-acquired case \u2013 would soon test positive. \n  \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019ve seen such a strong response over the last few days \u2013 23,000 tests yesterday is a fantastic reaction by the Victorian community,\u201d he said. \n  \u201cThis virus can cause trouble and obviously [I\u2019m] delighted that we don\u2019t have any more positive cases. \n  Weimar said about 7,000 tests were people who had visited the greater Sydney area, including the northern beaches, and the Central Coast.  \n  \u201cI would not be surprised if other members of the household do turn positive, but if they\u2019re isolating effectively and we\u2019ve got lots of people there to ensure that we support them to do just that, then the virus should not go any further,\u201d he said.  \n  \n Updated at 11.17pm GMT \n \n \n  10.46pm GMT  \n Labor calls for January vaccine rollout \n  \n  The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has made a significant intervention in the political debate by arguing the government should accelerate the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.He told ABC News Breakfast: \n   \n   Well, the problem here is ... that the federal government is saying that the TGA \u2013 the appropriate body which Labor supports and supports being able to do its work without interference \u2013 will make a decision with regard to the Pfizer vaccine in January, but the rollout won\u2019t commence until March under the agreement that the federal government has.  \n   That makes no sense.  \n   If the approval is made in January, it should be rolled out in January as a matter of urgency. And also there\u2019s only been provision made for 10 million doses \u2013 quite clearly we\u2019re going to need more than that. And so we need more vaccines, more quickly.\u201d \n   \n  Albanese noted that US president-elect Joe Biden received the jab on national TV yesterday \u2013 which gives an indication of what a potent political message this could be for Labor, as Australians will no doubt see many famous figures receiving the vaccine in coming weeks. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  Albanese also argued that the world\u2019s \u201cbest practice\u201d is to have as many vaccine deals as possible (six) but Australia only has three, after the UQ vaccine project was shut down. \n  As my colleague Melissa Davey has written in this handy explainer, Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt has justified the March rollout date by arguing that Australia has far fewer cases than countries that are fast-tracking it like the US, which has suffered hundreds of thousands of coronavirus deaths. \n  \n Updated at 10.49pm GMT \n \n \n  10.35pm GMT  \n  \n  Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese has called for the federal government to fast-track the vaccine and roll it out in January rather than March.  \n  We\u2019ll be bringing you more detail on that soon, but he said earlier today: \n   \n   If the TGA [Therapeutic Goods Administration] approves the vaccine in January, it just seems to me incredibly complacent for the government to say, no, we will sit around for another couple of months before it is available. \n   Surely, we should be making it available as soon as possible. We had president-elect Biden take the vaccine on national TV in the United States just yesterday. \n   Once the TGA approves a vaccine, like any other drug, then what they\u2019re saying, the professional body, is it is ready to go. If it is ready to go, let\u2019s roll it out.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.49pm GMT \n \n \n  10.11pm GMT  \n Victoria records zero new local cases \n  \n  Victoria has recorded no new local cases of Covid-19 today, with no spread yet among the contacts of 15-year old girl who returned from the northern beaches.  \n  Yesterday, the state reported that the girl had acquired the disease in NSW, and then returned home to Melbourne. \n  Today, the state has reported one new case of coronavirus \u2013 but it is in hotel quarantine. \n  There were 22,956 test results processed yesterday. The girl\u2019s family has so far tested negative, and Victoria health said that there were no known exposure sites in Victoria.  \n  The new overseas-acquired case brings the total active infections in hotel quarantine to 10.  \n   \n   \n    Yesterday there were 0 new local cases &amp; 0 lives lost. 0 new cases were acquired interstate, 1 international.

It\u2019s Naaman Zhou here with you. \n  Sydney residents will find out today whether they will spend Christmas under Covid restrictions. The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has promised a decision today on whether restrictions, which are due to expire at midnight tonight, will go into Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and even potentially the new year. \n  Yesterday she said it was an \u201chour by hour\u201d decision, even as Sydney recorded encouragingly low numbers of new cases. Only eight cases were recorded yesterday, out of a record 44,000 tests, with seven linked to the existing northern beaches cluster and one in a health worker who worked near returned travellers. \n  But there are still fears of greater spread, and a growing number of potential exposure sites, now spread across Sydney\u2019s CBD, north, east and south as well as regional NSW.  \n  Currently, residents of the northern beaches must stay at home unless for essential business, while residents of greater Sydney are limited to 10 visitors in their home and recommended not to visit aged care facilities. \n  Stay with us for all the latest. \n  \n", "Residential aged care providers given $190m \u2013 as it happened [2021-03-01T07:27:04Z]": "  7.01am GMT    What we learned, Monday 1 March    That\u2019s where I will leave you for today. Here\u2019s what we learned:  The Royal Commission into Aged Care was released. The government immediately committed to spending $452m on the sector, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised a more \u201ccomprehensive\u201d response in the next federal budget. The report was damning about the way the sector has been run. As well as handing down 148 recommendations, it found that elderly Australians have suffered declining quality of aged care due to decreasing funding levels as successive governments provided the struggling sector the \u201cbare minimum\u201d. Morrison also said the cabinet minister at the centre of historical rape allegations has \u201cvigorously rejected\u201d the claims, while admitting he was aware of \u201crumours\u201d of the alleged assault earlier this year. Morrison declined to launch an independent inquiry into the allegations, declaring he was \u201cnot a police force\u201d, despite the former lawyer for the woman, who is now deceased, saying the issue of criminal guilt \u201ccan\u2019t be resolved\u201d after her death.  The AstraZeneca vaccine will be ready for use next week, but NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian called for clarity from the federal government about how many doses would be available later this month. Data published by the health department shows some states are well behind others in administrating the vaccine.  Australian consular officials confirmed they are seeking to help Dr Osama AlHasani who has been detained in Morocco, as human rights activists raised fears the man may be extradited to Saudi Arabia. AlHasani is a dual Australian and Saudi citizen.     Updated at 7.27am GMT     6.21am GMT       The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, says the royal commission into aged care means there \u201cmust be no more excuses, no more delays\u201d in reforming the sector. Like everyone else, it appears the group only saw the eight-volume report today, so have not commented on the specific reformers but Khorshid says the government \u201cmust embrace this opportunity to make aged care a safe and high-quality place for older Australians, including improved access to medical care\u201d.  Older Australians deserve to have the same opportunity to have the best quality of life as everyone else, and the same access to high quality medical and nursing care they have enjoyed throughout their lives. Sadly, this Report shows that this has not been the case. In fact, far from it.\u201d \u201cThe AMA has continuously warned the Government that the health and aged care systems are not equipped to deal with the growing ageing population living longer and with multiple chronic diseases. \u201cTogether, the AMA and Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation have been calling on the Government to take urgent measures to improve the situation in aged care and bring comfort and confidence to our parents and grandparents who have given so much to their families and the communities throughout their lives. \u201cWith the release of the Royal Commission\u2019s final report, there must be no more excuses, no more delays. The reform process must start immediately. Care can\u2019t wait.\u201d     Updated at 6.40am GMT     6.08am GMT    Key report recommendation ignored as resident providers receive $190m funding    Ian Yates, the chief executive of the Council on the Ageing, has questioned whether it was appropriate for the Morrison government to provide $190m in funding to residential aged care providers in its immediate response to the aged care royal commission final report today. Speaking to ABC TV, Yates said he was \u201ca bit surprised\u201d that residential providers, some of which had been scorned in the final report, had been given the $189.9m in \u201ctemporary financial support\u201d without a requirement they spend it on staff \u2013 a key recommendation in the report.  Yates said: I must say I\u2019m a little bit surprised they have given residential care providers $190m without a condition that they spend it on staff. Which is what we have urged them to do.  Yates also played down the significance of the ideological split between the two aged care royal commissioners, Tony Pagone and Lynelle Briggs, which triggered several different and conflicting recommendations.

The Australian Government is concerned that charges have been laid against 47 pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong who were peacefully exercising their rights.

It\u2019s a damning report that must be answered properly, not with a measly $452m when the problem needs a multi-billion dollar solution. The commissioner has made 148 recommendations which need to be seriously considered. Prima facie, all need to implemented.\u201d  He\u2019s also (confusingly) used the report to criticise government over-spending on defence projects including its Future Submarines project.  The government can\u2019t let money be idly squandered in one portfolio whilst so much money is needed in another portfolio. The government must get on and fix what is a very broken system.\u201d     Updated at 5.28am GMT     5.03am GMT       The chief executive of the Council on the Ageing Australia, Ian Yates, spoke about the release of the report from Canberra a little while ago. He said the royal commission report was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d.  It does paint a not very pretty picture of a large amount of aged care in Australia. We welcome that. We\u2019ve been talking about that on behalf of older people for a decade. The government has had plenty of time to anticipate this, many of these recommendations were reflected in the final hearing late last year, so government is well-placed to respond by the budget.   On the disagreements on some recommendations by the commissioners Yates said the commissioners \u201cagree that we have to have a huge quantum increase in funding\u201d.   All they disagree about or have alternative views about is what is the best way of doing that ... The commissioners have alternative views about ... how do we get there, it\u2019s not where should we get to. There is no room for the government to try and wriggle out of any of the destinations that the royal commission points to. It is past time that we set out on the pathway.     Updated at 5.06am GMT     4.58am GMT       Labor\u2019s shadow minister for aged care Clare O\u2019Neil is responding to the release of the royal commission report.  She says the opposition will \u201cconsider this final report very carefully\u201d but won\u2019t comment on specifics, she says, because Labor didn\u2019t see the report until it was made public this afternoon. She says the federal government is \u201cgood at saying the right things about how they respect older Australians and then they go into the cabinet room and cut funding from this critical sector and look surprised when things go wrong\u201d.   I find that very disingenuous and I\u2019m really worried this will join the 21 other major reports the government has received during their time in office which have told them some variation on the themes that came out in the final report today.     Updated at 5.04am GMT     4.20am GMT       Morrison also spoke about the historical rape allegation against a cabinet minister revealed by the ABC last week.  The prime minister gave an interesting timeline. He says he spoke to the minister in question on Wednesday last week, who \u201cvigorously and completely denied the allegations\u201d. He also spoke to the head of the Australian federal police, Reece Kershaw, on Wednesday, as well as the secretary of his department. He says that after that conversation it\u2019s his view that: \u201cat this stage, there are no matters that require attention\u201d. Morrison insisted that it was a matter for the police, despite the fact that the woman who reportedly made the allegations has since died. Asked whether he had read the materials sent to him about the rape allegation, Morrison said:  I\u2019m aware of the contents of them. I\u2019ve been briefed on the contents of them. And it was appropriate, as the commissioner himself advised the parliament, to refer any allegations to the properly authorities.   He also made some interesting comments about when he first heard about the allegations. He said he received the anonymous materials laying out the allegations which were sent to his office on Wednesday, when he spoke to the minister in question. However, he also had this back and forth with a journalist in which he says he was aware of \u201crumours\u201d but that he did not pursue those rumours.  Journalist: And had you heard about these claims at all before last week? Morrison: No, not really of any substance, no. Journalist: What had you heard if not of substance? Morrison: Only rumours of an ABC investigative journalist making some inquiries. That\u2019s all I\u2019d heard. I didn\u2019t know the substance of them. Journalist: Did you know who it was about when you heard those rumours or when you heard vaguely about [the rumours]. Morrison: I tend to not pay attention to rumours ... I wasn\u2019t aware of the substance of it and as a result not in a position to pursue it. When I was put in a position to pursue it, I did.    Updated at 5.04am GMT     4.07am GMT       So maybe we should briefly recap. The prime minister Scott Morrison announced the release of the Royal Commission into aged care, committing $425m in an initial response but saying the government\u2019s full response won\u2019t come until the federal budget. The report made 148 recommendations, including the approval of home care packages within one month from the date of a person\u2019s assessment, and clearing the current wait list by the end of the year. It also recommends putting the power to prescribe anti-psychotic drugs for aged care residents in the hands of a psychiatrist or geriatrician to restrict their use. Morrison admitted it would take \u201cquite considerable time to achieve the scale of change\u201d recommended by the report, but some of the immediate measures will include $18m to enhance oversight of home care packages and $92m to create more than 18,000 places for additional aged care workers between now and mid-2023. Responding to the report on the ABC just now, Prof Joe Ibrahim, the head of the Health, Law and Ageing Research Unit at Monash University, called the response \u201cunderwhelming\u201d.  \u201cThe 450m that has been allocated now is less than 3% of the total annual budget for aged care so it\u2019s really just, it\u2019s not very much at all and what the prime minister has said is they will simply be doing more of the same, but the things that are not working, we will just do more of them. We will do more audits with the regulator when we know the regulator has been ineffectual and not working. So it does not make any sense and it doesn\u2019t put us on the path for the generational change.     Updated at 4.14am GMT     3.53am GMT       And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Goodness me.       3.50am GMT       Morrison is asked whether it\u2019s acceptable for a cabinet minister to remain in his position given the allegations raised by Four Corners. He says the AFP commissioner has not told him that he should take action.  Morrison:  I think it\u2019s appropriate for the federal police to deal with it and for the federal police to advise me of the nature of this, which they\u2019re doing. At this stage, the commissioner has raised no issue with me and the department secretary was present for that call as well, that would cause me to take action under the ministerial code. That\u2019s where we are, right now. And, you know, I\u2019m aware of other allegations, and, you know, I think similar \u2013 similar principles apply. We\u2019ve got to be careful to ensure that we still follow the rule of law in this country.     Updated at 3.54am GMT     3.47am GMT       Morrison on his conversation with the minister in question on Wednesday:  I\u2019m not going to go into the conversation. Simply to tell you I was asked. Did I raise it? Yes, I did. And he vigorously and completely denied the allegations. So that means there is a proper process now for it to follow.        3.46am GMT       Morrison says he won\u2019t be launching an inquiry to the allegations, saying it\u2019s the job of police. One of the reporters points out that given the woman who reportedly made the allegations has since died, it is unlikely the police will be able to relaunch any investigation into the incident. He again says it is appropriate to pass it on to the Australian federal police.     Updated at 3.47am GMT     3.44am GMT    Morrison says cabinet minister has denied historical rape allegations    Morrison is asked whether he has asked the cabinet minister who is facing allegations of a historical rape whether he denies them.  Yes, I have and he absolutely does.  He says the conversation occurred on Wednesday last week. He says he also spoke to the commissioner of the AFP, the secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet and the deputy secretary.  Asked whether he knew about it before Wednesday, he says:  No, not really of any substance, no ... Only rumours of an ABC investigative journalist making some inquiries. That\u2019s all I\u2019d heard. I didn\u2019t know the substance of them ... I tend to not pay attention to the rumours.\u201d  He\u2019s asked what he did with the materials and says that he forwarded them to the AFP. Asked whether he read them, he says:  I\u2019m aware of the contents of them. I\u2019ve been briefed on the contents of them. And it was appropriate, as the commissioner himself advised the parliament, to refer any allegations to the proper authorities. That is the way in our country under the rule of law things like this are dealt with. It is important to ensure that we uphold that. That is the way our society operates. Now, these are very distressing issues that have been raised, as there are other issues that have been raised in relation to other members in other cases. But the proper place for that to be dealt is by the authorities, which are the police. That\u2019s how our country operates.     Updated at 4.27am GMT     3.38am GMT       Aged and Community Services Australia chief executive Patricia Sparrow says the split in recommendations in the royal commissions is \u201cby no means an excuse to delay major aged care reform\u201d.   There is no split on the need for a total overhaul that means providers are resourced to employ more staff and deliver more care and support. This cannot be used as an excuse to not progress major reforms. We know what the big problems are \u2013 we now need the big solutions.  There is a lot of work that the industry can get on with in order to deliver better aged care to Australia, but without increased support from government and community we won\u2019t see the kind of system older people deserve.\u201d  The government has announced $452.2m as a starting point for reform. We welcome this but the most important thing now is a complete overhaul.  We need an overhaul, not just more top-ups, in order to guarantee respect for older Australians for future generations.\u201d     Updated at 3.38am GMT     3.26am GMT       There\u2019s a kind of weird dynamic going on at this press conference. A few journalists are attempting to ask Scott Morrison questions about the historical rape allegations made against one of his cabinet ministers last week, but he\u2019s declining to take them until there are no more questions about aged care.     Updated at 3.29am GMT     3.18am GMT       He\u2019s asked whether it was a tactical decision by the government to release the report as Morrison was standing up to take questions about it.  One of the journalists asks the prime minister whether it was \u201ca tactic\u201d. Morrison:  No, with respect, today is not about the media. Today is about releasing the royal commission report. There are eight volumes, and I would encourage you to digest all of them. And on occasion, after occasion, after occasion, I have no doubt you will quiz me on it. Today is the day for us telling Australia that it is released. There\u2019ll be plenty of other opportunities.     Updated at 3.20am GMT     3.16am GMT       Morrison is asked what the government\u2019s top priority is in the commission\u2019s report. Morrison:  There\u2019s one thing that I think pretty much sums up the whole approach and that is the person to whom you\u2019re seeking to provide care has to be at the centre. That\u2019s the nub of this. That their dignity, that their care, that the respect for them as a human being and a fellow Australian has to sit at the centre.  Now that\u2019s not a glib statement. That\u2019s a statement with great policy power behind it. And that\u2019s the sort of thing that should enshrined in the act, as the royal commission has recommended.     Updated at 3.20am GMT     3.15am GMT       Morrison is asked how he will address the fact the two commissioners have offered differing recommendations on some aspects of aged care reform. He says the government \u201cwill exercise our considered judgment\u201d.   We will work with the sector. The fact the commissioners have come to different views I think highlights the complexity of this problem. This is my trust of the Australian people. Our issues that we have to deal with are very complex and difficult in government. I don\u2019t think Australians think this is easy to fix. If it was, then someone would have done it a long time ago. I can tell you, plenty of people have tried in the past and they haven\u2019t succeeded. And they\u2019ve done it with the best of intentions.       Updated at 3.43am GMT     3.13am GMT    'Generational change is now required': Scott Morrison    Morrison is asked first how much it will cost to implement the commission\u2019s recommendations. He says he doesn\u2019t know.  The royal commission doesn\u2019t know the answer yet.  But you know in our country we have a needs-based system of healthcare. In our country we don\u2019t have a needs-based system of aged care. No government has done that ever \u2013 ever \u2013 and the result of that is what we read in this report today. That\u2019s why I say that generational change is now required.     Updated at 3.15am GMT     3.03am GMT       Hunt says the government will adopt the commission\u2019s recommendation to extend the viability supplement as an interim measure. \u201cThere will be a long-term solution to that issue set out in the budget.\u201d He says the government will \u201cmake available immediately for 18,000 places to supplement those which have already been brought in for new home care and residential care workers to be trained because if we can lift those numbers, we lift the places that we offer. And that is a critical step forward and then finally in terms of governance.\u201d    Updated at 3.34am GMT     3.00am GMT    Government will act immediately on fees and audits: Hunt    Hunt is now getting into some of the detail of what the government proposes to do in the sector on receipt of the report. On home care, the government will immediately act on transparency of fees and commence an audit program of more than 500 facilities a year. He says the government will also implement a new quality control system within home care.    In the quality and safety of residential care, Hunt says the government will \u201ccommence the process of 1,500 extra audits of facilities per year under the aged care quality and safety commissioner\u201d. Under that commission regulation will be put in place \u201cto ensure furthers protection against chemical and physical restraint\u201d.  The government will also appoint a new senior restraint leader within the commission \u201cand we will extend the pharmacy program within the commission and under the department to 2025\u201d.    Updated at 3.04am GMT     2.55am GMT       Health minister Greg Hunt is now speaking. He too invokes his parents, and his father who spent his final months in aged care.  We know that the are 1.3 million people within the aged care system in Australia. Home support, home care, residential aged care.  And this monumental report, eight volumes, 148 recommendations, monumental in scope, two years in construction, over 10,000 submissions, 640 witnesses, sets out some fundamental choices.  And, yes, there are some alternative approaches that have been presented by the commissioners. But the central vision is of a nation where we value our elders, where we respect them, we provide care and we provide dignity. And we respond to their individual needs. That\u2019s the critical thing.     Updated at 2.56am GMT     2.51am GMT    It will take 'considerable time' for scale of changes    He says it will take \u201cquite considerable time to achieve the scale of change that we want to and need to\u201d.   The commissioner sets out a five-year timeframe for the measures that are set out in the report. And we must also take care in how we do this.   In terms of addressing workforce issues:  We cannot just take people off the streets and put them into people\u2019s homes and ask them to start caring for people. That would be irresponsible. If someone is going to go into someone\u2019s home or go into the room that they\u2019re living in a residential aged care facility, we cannot compromise on the standards that should be there for those workers to be able to provide that support. And so we will seek to address the significant workforce issues and the standards issues and the quality issues and the governance issues.     Updated at 2.54am GMT     2.48am GMT       Morrison talks about his own father\u2019s time in an aged care home.   You cannot separate the personal element of this ... whether in discharging your responsibilities as a prime minister, a minister, an aged care provider, a regulator, a carer, a worker, a cleaner, people who deliver the meals.  We are all part of a system that is supposed to be providing the best quality care we can for older Australians, particularly as they age.   Morrison says he decided to call for the royal commission when he became prime minister and \u201ccouldn\u2019t get the answer I wanted\u201d about the quality of care in aged care.  It was impossible to hear that because it wasn\u2019t the case. No one could give that assurance to me.  And the royal commission has now, I think, set out a very important roadmap which I think will establish generational change in this country when it comes to aged care. It\u2019s the inquiry we needed to have. It\u2019s well considered. It\u2019s honest. It\u2019s positive. It\u2019s compassionate. It\u2019s comprehensive. It\u2019s candid. It\u2019s passionate and it\u2019s ambitious. All the things I hope it would be when I called it.     Updated at 2.51am GMT     2.43am GMT    Morrison says report is 'personal'    Morrison is speaking now. He\u2019s spent the past few days reading the report. Says it is \u201cpersonal. The care of those we love is personal.\u201d    Updated at 2.45am GMT     2.42am GMT    PM commits $452.2m in additional aged care funding    Ahead of their press conference Scott Morrison and health minister Greg Hunt have issued a (long) statement on the royal commission\u2019s findings. Morrison says the report\u2019s 148 recommendations \u201cdeliver a challenging, but achievable road to reform\u201d. He says there is \u201ca clear roadmap to improve respect and care for our older Australians\u201d. Morrison:  I called this royal commission to ensure our oldest and most frail Australians could receive the respect and care that supports their dignity, and recognises the contribution that they have made to society. I warned when I called the royal commission there will be stories that will be hard to hear. And that has been the case. But at the same time, we have also heard heartwarming cases of dedication and with the challenges of Covid-19 in the past year, we need to acknowledge the hard work performed by our aged care workforce. As I noted at the time, Australians must be able to trust that their loved ones will be cared for appropriately and the community should have confidence in the system. This remains our clear goal.  Today the Australian government is continuing to drive reforms with additional funding of $452.2m to address immediate priorities in the sector. These immediate steps will drive improved quality of care by strengthening aged care provider governance, and improved oversight of home care which will ensure senior Australians and taxpayers are getting value for money. It will provide additional financial assistance for residential care providers so they can improve care, whilst building the much needed workforce of the future to support Australians who want to age in their own homes.     Updated at 2.49am GMT     2.39am GMT       The chair of the royal commission, Tony Pagone QC, in his foreword to the final report, confirms the two commissioners have differed on some points.  Here\u2019s what he writes:  Many of our recommendations and observations are made jointly, but there are some instances where we make differing recommendations and observations. We have agreed, with some misgivings and not without anxious consideration, to make some separate recommendations and to express different views where we diverge. But we both strongly conclude that fundamental change is needed. In the end, the differences between us may add to the strength of the reforms which are to be made. I recommend, in accepting the submissions of counsel assisting, an independent commission model, whilst commissioner Briggs recommends a government leadership model ... The adoption of one model over the other will have consequences for many, but not all, of the recommendations we make.

We\u2019re standing by to hear from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, ahead of the release of the aged care royal commission\u2019s final report, hopefully in about 10 minutes. The report has not yet been released, but as my colleague Nino Bucci told you a little earlier, the two commissioners have reportedly arrived at different conclusions on how best to reform the sector.     Updated at 2.35am GMT     2.09am GMT       I\u2019m going to pass the blog to my colleague Michael McGowan. Enjoy your afternoon.       2.08am GMT    Here is a recap of the news so far on Monday:     The aged care royal commissioners have reportedly arrived at a split decision on how to reform the sector. Scott Morrison, Greg Hunt and Richard Colbeck are due to speak about the commission\u2019s final report at 1.30pm Federal government ministers called for police to be allowed to investigate rape allegations levelled against a cabinet colleague, after the alleged victim\u2019s lawyer described his position as \u201cuntenable\u201d The AstraZeneca vaccine will be ready for use next week, but NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian called for clarity from the federal government about how many doses would be available later this month Another director, John Poynton, resigned from Crown resorts No new Covid-19 cases were recorded in Victoria or NSW.

The PM and Ministers Hunt and Colbeck will hold a press conference at 1.30pm on the release of the Aged Care Royal Commission&#39;s final report.&mdash; Shalailah Medhora (@shalailah) March 1, 2021         1.51am GMT       A leading industry group says Australia should consider allowing temporary visa holders to fill permanent migrant place, as companies complain of skills shortages.  Ai-Group\u2019s Anthony Melville told a parliamentary inquiry hearing into skilled migration on Monday the pandemic was expected to have a \u201clong-term impact on the permanent migration numbers\u201d, which he said would fall dramatically.  He said:   This has got economic consequences, including lost years of net migration, and that will not be replaced. There will also be slower GDP growth, residential construction is already suffering, all those industries that feed into that. We have suggested a couple of things. You could look at the one million or so temporary visa holders in Australia at the moment as a source of permanent migrants. Obviously they would have to meet all the various criteria for permanent migrants. But there is a big pool there of people who are Covid free, if you like.  Julie Toth, the chief economist at Ai-Group, said there were significant skills shortages despite high unemployment.  She noted that most of the job losses during the pandemic had been in areas such as retail, hospitality, performing arts, tourism and transport.   The skills shortages we\u2019re seeing are in the industrial areas. Engineering construction, a little bit of residential construction, and parts of manufacturing that have either seen increased demand or not much of a drop in demand.      Updated at 2.04am GMT     1.41am GMT    Penny Wong urges Morrison government to condemn Myanmar military    Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, has issued a strong statement condemning the latest violence against protesters in Myanmar. Wong wants the Morrison government to be equally forceful in its communications with the Myanmar junta, the Tatmadaw, which seized power in a coup on 1 February. Wong said:  Labor condemns the recent violence against protesters in Myanmar, in which at least 18 people have died. Reports that security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters are deeply distressing and such actions are completely unacceptable.  The people of Myanmar have shown enormous courage in the wake of the 1 February coup in expressing their support for democracy and human rights.  It has been a month since the coup, but the Australian government has still not made clear what it has done to oppose the recent actions of the Tatmadaw, including the mass arrests of democratically elected leaders, political figures and protesters. The Morrison government must send a strong signal to the Tatmadaw that the bilateral relationship won\u2019t return to business as usual until democracy is restored.  Amid the escalating crackdown against protesters by the military regime, the Australian government must explain what steps it is taking to support the people of Myanmar and to oppose the coup. [Foreign affairs minister] Marise Payne instead referred to the \u2018incoming government of Myanmar\u2019 on 9 February and has announced reviews into bilateral cooperation.  This ... response is simply not good enough. Australia cannot be a bystander to a direct attack on Myanmar\u2019s democracy.       Updated at 1.51am GMT     1.28am GMT       The Queensland government will not pay the bill for returned traveller quarantine from New South Wales (in case you were in any doubt after this fairly bizarre stunt last week from deputy premier Steven Miles):    Queensland&#39;s Deputy Premier Steven Miles has filmed himself ripping up a tax invoice from the NSW Government asking Queensland to pay for their residents who quarantined in NSW. #9News Details: https://t.co/a3SjH0VdvS pic.twitter.com/uYAPUfZwp5&mdash; 9News Australia (@9NewsAUS) February 25, 2021    Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said today it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that NSW had sent Queensland a bill, and used the furore to again press the federal government about whether a new quarantine facility could be approved. She wants prime minister Scott Morrison to approve flights into Toowoomba so that her government can decide if a hub should be established.  I think it is absolutely ridiculous for NSW to be sending us a bill. I mean, we obviously are doing quarantine for some of their residents. We are not charging them. This is normal work that we have been doing. Also, too, we still are firmly of the view that we need an answer from the prime minister about whether or not he will allow flights into Toowoomba so we can decide one way or another whether we are going to have this regional quarantine hub in Toowoomba.     Updated at 1.35am GMT     1.18am GMT       Gladys Berejiklian says the New South Wales government does not know yet how many vaccinations it will be able to administer in two weeks time. She said the federal government had not provided information about how many doses could be administered after the fourth week of the vaccination program, which is two weeks away. \u201cWe do have the capacity to provide more vaccinations to our citizens than what we had anticipated,\u201d she said.    \u201cWe just need to know how many doses we have so we can make that happen.\u201d She said an average of 48 people an hour were being vaccinated in the state, and that more than 10,000 people had already received the first dose of vaccine. \u201cNSW is well on track to meet our target of 35,000 vaccinations to be administered in the first three weeks.\u201d    Updated at 1.37am GMT     12.55am GMT    More detained refugees in Brisbane to be released    Dozens more detained refugees transferred from offshore detention will soon be released on bridging visas in Brisbane, AAP reports. A further 25 people at Brisbane immigration transit accommodation have been told they will be freed on Monday, the Refugee Action Coalition says. RAC spokesman Ian Rintoul says the refugees had been held at a Kangaroo Point hotel from where 63 were released in December and January. He criticised the federal government for failing to provide enough support for those being released.    Rintoul says they are being given only three weeks\u2019 accommodation and bridging visas, when they should be being properly resettled. \u201cThey can\u2019t be sent home or back to offshore detention yet they are left with an uncertain future,\u201d he said. Another 70 refugees will be released over the next two days but about 70 remain at the Kangaroo Point hotel. Rintoul said there was no difference between the groups and all refugees should be set free. \u201cThe government\u2019s lack of transparency and chaotic release of medevac refugees is causing increased anxiety and stress among those left behind,\u201d he said. \u201cEight years of detention and human rights abuse is too long. They should all be released immediately.\u201d The RAC will protest for the release of the remaining refugees being held at the Kangaroo Point hotel at 5pm on Monday. Guardian Australia has recently reported on legal action involving other medevac detainees.    Updated at 1.12am GMT     12.49am GMT       A group of University of Queensland academics are pushing for reform of Australia\u2019s espionage laws, saying they expose journalists to sentences of life imprisonment and are discouraging public interest journalism. Australia\u2019s Espionage Act 2018 can be used to prosecute individuals who handle sensitive information with the intent of communicating it to \u201cforeign principals\u201d.  No journalist has been prosecuted under the laws in the three years since they came into effect.  But Dr Rebecca Ananian-Welsh at the University of Queensland\u2019s school of law said the law criminalises a \u201cwide range of conduct\u201d that journalists regularly engage in. The potential of imprisonment is a \u201chuge concern for news companies, journalists, and their sources\u201d. \u201cJournalists communicate to \u2018foreign principals\u2019 every time they publish a story to the world at large,\u201d she said.  Ananian-Welsh and her colleagues believe there should be a specific exemption for public interest journalism inserted into the law.  \u201cThe law\u2019s complexity and breadth is a problem in itself. Legal experts struggle to unpack and understand the offences,\u201d she said.  \u201cJournalists, even with the help of in-house counsel, face a daunting task in assessing whether they, or a source, might be crossing a line into criminality if they discuss sensitive matters or international relations with a source, especially one with access to classified information.\u201d Ananian-Welsh and her colleagues are publishing the press freedom policy papers series, which aims to drive reform of espionage, whistleblowing, and free speech law.  Prof Peter Greste, a former foreign correspondent and now UQ professor, has been working with Aranian-Welsh on her research.       Updated at 1.17am GMT     12.42am GMT       Energy minister Angus Taylor has reiterated earlier comments from treasurer Josh Frydenberg that allegations of rape levelled at a cabinet minister should be left to police to investigate. Taylor has just finished speaking in Newcastle.  Look, this has been referred to the police. The AFP and the New South Wales police. It should be left to run through those processes. The prime minister got very clear advice from the AFP commissioner on this. These things should be referred to the police and left to the police and that\u2019s absolutely appropriate.  Taylor agreed he was concerned about the allegations made against MPs and staffers in recent weeks, and had used the events as an opportunity to speak with his office about how to report inappropriate behaviour to ensure they felt safe at work.     Well, I mean any allegation that\u2019s serious ... of this nature, is of course something we should all be concerned about. We should be concerned in particular to make sure these things don\u2019t happen again in the future. I have certainly ... spent time with my team, making sure they understand the situation and most importantly they understand the channels for them to deal with any issue that may occur in the workplace. It\u2019s very important we have our teams right across the parliament, both sides, all sides of politics, feeling they have a safe, effective, working environment, and certainly I\u2019ll be doing everything I can to make sure that\u2019s true, as I have in the past, in my team.     Updated at 12.48am GMT     12.10am GMT       The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is speaking in Devonport. In relation to allegations of rape and sexual assault involving politicians and staffers, he says everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence.  Every Australian deserves that right. So, yes, there have been very serious matters raised across the parliament in recent weeks. This has been the subject of much commentary and attention. But the focus has to be now on process. And we have seen a letter from the head of the Australian federal police and that letter, to the prime minister and subsequently made available to the parliament, again re-emphasises the need for these matters to be in the hands of authorities. They are the best people to be dealing with such matters.  He was asked specifically about the allegations involving a cabinet minister, and replied: \u201cAgain, the process has now been laid out. And everybody, including that cabinet minister that you referred to, is entitled to the presumption of innocence.\u201d    Frydenberg was also asked about the complaint relating to a Labor MP:  It referred to a person on the other side of politics. It didn\u2019t refer to their specific name. Those matters have been referred to the police. I think it\u2019s really important here that we understand that people are entitled to the presumption of innocence. It doesn\u2019t matter what political party they come from, doesn\u2019t matter what business they work for, doesn\u2019t matter their background, their race, religion, their ethnicity, they are entitled to the presumption of innocence. And this is Australia, after all.

Scott Morrison is facing mounting calls to stand aside a senior cabinet minister accused of raping a woman before entering politics. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Labor\u2019s Penny Wong and the prime minister were sent a letter detailing the complaint last week. The incident is alleged to have occurred in 1988 when the woman was 16. The woman went to NSW police last year but the investigation was suspended when she took her own life after telling authorities she didn\u2019t want to proceed. Hanson-Young believes the minister must stand aside pending an independent investigation by a an eminent former judge. She said it was important for the woman\u2019s voice to be heard and for the minister to be able to clear his name if innocent. \u201cIt is just not right to suggest that this type of allegation could linger, hang over the heads of the entire cabinet,\u201d she told ABC radio on Monday. \u201cSitting around that table erodes the trust the integrity and belief that this government takes sexual assault seriously.\u201d Marque Lawyers managing partner Michael Bradley, who represented the woman when she took the complaint to police, questioned whether the minister could do his job with his integrity under question.    \u201cI think he will have to stand aside, at the moment at least, because he\u2019s been accused of such a grave crime,\u201d Bradley told Nine newspapers. \u201cIt\u2019s untenable for him not to, I would think. It\u2019s not really a legal question \u2013 it\u2019s a question of propriety.\u201d Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the allegation needed to be investigated appropriately and not politically managed. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull received a letter from the woman in late 2019 asking for his advice. \u201cShe described a pretty horrific rape that she said had occurred at the hands of this person, a person she said is now in the cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things she noted, I might say, is that she\u2019d kept extensive diaries. She mentioned that she had a lawyer and was talking to the NSW police.\u201d Liberal senator Sarah Henderson has forwarded police an email from a woman who claims she was raped by a serving Labor MP. The AFP confirmed they received a complaint relating to an historical sexual assault but would not comment further. Sexual assault allegations have sparked national debate about political culture after former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins said she was raped by a colleague in Parliament House. Four inquiries are under way, including a multi-party investigation aimed at ensuring parliament is a safe working environment.    Updated at 11.28pm GMT     11.13pm GMT       Manufacturing is bouncing back from last year\u2019s recession, the Australian Industry Group says. AAP reports that the manufacturing index grew by a further 3.5 points in February to 58.8, its strongest expansion since March 2018. Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said manufacturers lifted production and employment in February as sales recovered a large share of the ground lost in 2020.    \u201cManufacturers are generally positive about the outlook for the next few months with new orders coming in at a greater pace as restrictions on activity and cross-border travel are hopefully wound back,\u201d Willox said. The report comes ahead of Wednesday\u2019s national accounts for the December quarter which are expected to show the economy grew by a further 2.4% in the final three months of 2020. This builds on the huge 3.3% rebound in the previous three months after collapsing 7% in the June quarter which marked the first recession since the early 1990s as a result of the pandemic.

The woman contacted the New South Wales police in February 2020, telling detectives from the child abuse and sex crimes squad she had been raped. She had engaged lawyer Michael Bradley and told friends about the allegation, but took her own life in June last year. She had not provided a formal statement before her death. The South Australian coroner is investigating the suicide. Bradley told the ABC on Monday: \u201cIt was a very tragic story from beginning to end. It\u2019s a deeply unpleasant experience to have that happen to your client. All of my thoughts were and remain with her.\u201d    Updated at 10.23pm GMT     9.49pm GMT    Another resignation from the board of Crown    Crown Resorts has just released a statement confirming that John Poynton, the chairman and director of its Perth casino and a director of Crown, had resigned with immediate effect. The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority had advised Crown that it was appropriate Poynton step down due to a perceived lack of independence because of his past relationship with James Packer.    Crown\u2019s executive chairman, Helen Coonan, said:  John has been a member of the board of Crown since November 2018 and a director of Crown Perth since 2004. During that time, he has been enormously committed as a director, chairman of Crown Perth and through his service on board committees. The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) has advised Crown that it considers it appropriate that John step down as a director of all companies within the Crown group, due to a perceived lack of independence arising out of his past relationship with Mr James Packer and CPH, notwithstanding the recent termination of John\u2019s consultancy arrangement with CPH. As a result, John has agreed to resign in the best interests of Crown and our shareholders, despite no adverse findings by the commissioner in the ILGA inquiry in relation to his suitability, integrity or performance. On behalf of the board, I thank John for his contribution to Crown over many years.  There has been a string of resignations from Crown in recent weeks, including its chief executive Ken Barton, following revelations from a NSW inquiry which sparked independent investigations in Victoria and Western Australia.

There\u2019s a lot to unpack but basically Neill-Fraser was convicted entirely on circumstantial evidence, Chappell\u2019s body has never been found, and much of the appeal is set to focus on why DNA from a troubled teenager was on the yacht. It is also a test of right to appeal laws, which have been implemented in some states to allow for court hearings if new evidence emerges. Here\u2019s a story from AAP: More than a decade after being convicted of murdering her partner, Hobart grandmother Susan Neill-Fraser has another chance to prove her innocence. The body of Bob Chappell, who disappeared off the couple\u2019s yacht on Australia Day 2009, has never been found. Neill-Fraser, now 67, is serving 23 years in jail but has always maintained she did not kill the 65-year-old, her partner of 18 years. Today she will embark on a landmark appeal hearing in the supreme court of Tasmania having convinced a judge there \u201cfresh and compelling\u201d evidence that was not heard at the original trial. The reliability of the evidence \u2013 which centres on then 15-year-old homeless girl Meaghan Vass whose DNA was found on the Four Winds yacht \u2013 will be tested in front of a three-judge panel. Vass denied being on the boat at the original trial but has signed an affidavit saying she was on board when Chappell was attacked.    Neill-Fraser\u2019s lawyers have also questioned evidence led by the prosecution at the trial relating to DNA and blood testing and a \u201cmisleading\u201d winching reconstruction on the yacht. It was found Neill-Fraser attacked Chappell, dumped his body in the Derwent river and then tried to sink the boat. \u201cIt was a deliberate killing for the purpose of some sort of personal gain,\u201d Justice Alan Blow wrote in sentencing remarks after her 2010 conviction. The case against Neill-Fraser was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the appeal is successful she could face a retrial or her conviction could be quashed. High-profile lawyer Robert Richter QC, who represented Cardinal George Pell, will lead Neill-Fraser\u2019s legal team at the five-day hearing. Vass is expected to give evidence via video link. Neill-Fraser, who is eligible for parole in August 2022, won the right to a second appeal in 2019 under new Tasmanian laws that required \u201cfresh and compelling\u201d evidence to be brought forward. Her first appeal was dismissed by the court of criminal appeal in 2012.    Updated at 10.54pm GMT     9.15pm GMT       The fabled \u201cthylacine\u201d photos are finally out and they are ... pretty blurry.  Last week Neil Waters, president of the Thylacine Awareness Group of Australia, an amateur not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the elusive creature, took to YouTube claiming he had photos proving there were three Tasmanian tigers living and breeding in north-east Tasmania, which would be released on 1 March.     March 1st is finally here and that means Neil Water\u2019s fabled thylacine photos have been released! An expert from the Tasmanian Museum says they are likely pademelons, what do you reckon? (Number 3 is considered the \u2018smoking gun\u2019) pic.twitter.com/3cwlfoPyVw&mdash; Matilda Boseley (@MatildaBoseley) February 28, 2021    But before the photos were made public wildlife expert Nick Mooney from the Tasmanian Museum examined them and dismissed the claims, declaring the animals photographed were most likely pademelons \u2013 a wallaby-like marsupial. At midnight Waters released a YouTube video where he shows the photos and they seem to be far from the \u201csmoking gun\u201d promised. A nighttime photo shows two glowing eyes on an animal with an interesting jaw; another shows the back a small animal that, I\u2019ll admit, does have some distinct stripes and looks a little tigerish, and the last is ... well it sure looks like a pademelon to the untrained eye. In the video Waters disagrees:  Again we have an interesting shot. \u2018Yeah sure that\u2019s a pademelon.\u2019 Is it? Have another good look at it. There are some very telltale signs here that this is everything but a pademelon ... The mother and the father are clearly a little bit ambiguous; they\u2019re not giving away many secrets. But why the hell would a baby thylacine \u2013 which I\u2019m absolutely confident that this animal is \u2013 be the following a pademelon and being followed by a pademelon. Questions do arise out of this bizarre revelation.  The photos aren\u2019t the crystal-clear Tassie tiger family shot that many might have been expecting, but the thylacine enthusiasts in the comments seem to be pretty jazzed nonetheless.

Updated at 9.27pm GMT     9.09pm GMT    NSW to ban toxic firefighting chemical, PFAS    The New South Wales government will ban the use of firefighting foam containing the environmental contaminant PFAS, its environment minister, Matt Kean, has announced. On Monday Kean said the ban would mean that from next month firefighting foam containing PFAS would be banned in training or demonstrations. Further restrictions including on the use and sale of the foam in portable fire extinguishers would be introduced from September 2022. The use of firefighting foam containing PFAS has been one of the main sources of contamination from the substance, which has resulted in a series of class action lawsuits against the defence department after widespread pollution was discovered in residential areas. Its use has prompted hundreds of investigations into contamination at sites across Australia.     Kean said: \u201cFirefighting foam is the key cause of PFAS contamination in the NSW environment with concentrations detected at airports, defence sites, emergency service facilities, training facilities, major hazard facilities and their surrounding environments. \u201cThis ban on PFAS firefighting foam will significantly reduce the impact on our environment but still enable our emergency agencies to fight catastrophic fires that can have devastating impacts on life and property.\u201d  The introduction of the ban is curious, given the defence department, most commercial airports, and state and territory fire brigades phased out PFAS-based foams several years ago. But a previous regulation impact statement issued by the federal environment department warned that legacy stocks of the foam are still used by private industry at places such as docks, oil refineries and dangerous goods storage facilities.    Updated at 9.45pm GMT     9.07pm GMT       The health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed on Sunday that the federal government had established a myth-busting unit to tackle Covid-19 misinformation.   Related: Australian 'myth-busting' unit established to take on Covid misinformation      When we say Covid-19 misinformation, many of you probably immediately think of the former Liberal (now independent) MP, Craig Kelly. But the creation of this unit also made me think of the excellent Web of Lies series we have been running at Guardian Australia which you should definitely dig into.    Updated at 9.10pm GMT     8.55pm GMT    Royal commmission 'split' over aged care reform    Well this is curious. The two commissioners who presided over the aged care royal commission have reportedly arrived at different conclusions about how to reform the sector. The report is set to be released today.    This is part of a story from AAP: The final report of the two-and-a-half-year federal inquiry was received by the government on Friday and is expected to include more than 100 recommendations. However, the Australian newspaper says the contrasting philosophical views of commissioners Tony Pagone QC and Lynelle Briggs has resulted in some split findings. Citing multiple sources, the paper says the report contains contrasting recommendations for a new model that would mean either higher taxes or greater user-pay contributions to fix funding shortfalls. The Australian says the report will be released on Monday, with an interim government response to follow. More detailed commitments are expected in the May federal budget. Health minister Greg Hunt says the commission\u2019s final report is \u201cmonumental\u201d in its scope and vision. \u201cThe full report ... will be released as soon as we\u2019ve had a chance to work through the eight volumes but that will be in the very, very near future,\u201d he said on Sunday. The commission was told countless tales of abuse and neglect and its 2019 interim paper urged a complete overhaul of a \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d system. It found there was an overuse of drugs to \u201crestrain\u201d aged care residents, and younger people with disabilities were stuck in aged care. Pay and conditions for staff were poor, workloads heavy and severe difficulties existed in recruitment and retention. Mandated staffing ratios, increased regulatory powers and new laws to protect the rights of elderly people are among recommendations made by lawyers assisting the commission. The sector, which is predominantly funded by the commonwealth, has come under increased scrutiny during the pandemic with 685 aged care residents dying from Covid-19.    Updated at 10.59pm GMT     8.31pm GMT       Good morning. It\u2019s 1 March, 2021. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s happening today: The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has confirmed that the first 300,000 doses of the new AstraZeneca vaccine will start rolling out by next Monday. He also revealed the government \u201cquietly\u201d set up a \u201cmyth-busting unit\u201d last year to address what he\u2019s called \u201cplainly ridiculous\u201d misinformation surrounding the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, amid increasing concerns about the spread of false information and conspiracy theories.  In other vaccine news, some experts think Australia\u2019s goal of vaccinating the entire adult population by October might just be feasible, even though it would require an extremely high daily rate of 180,000 doses. And new data suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may be less effective in people with obesity.  Legal experts are calling for an independent investigation of the historical rape alleged to have been committed by a federal cabinet minister, citing it as a \u201cvery serious\u201d integrity issue. Anthony Albanese, while agreeing the matter is best handled by police, yesterday called it a \u201ctest\u201d for Scott Morrison, who must decide if the minister should continue in his current position. He refused to say how he would handle a similar allegation against a Labor frontbencher, arguing that this was hypothetical. But Liberal senator Sarah Henderson last night referred a rape allegation against an unnamed Labor member of parliament to the federal police. The heads of hundreds of private schools across New South Wales will be briefed by the boss of the police sex crimes squad this week as the sector scrambles to address concerns raised by a viral petition that has gathered more than 3,000 testimonies of alleged sexual assault committed by high school students. Two conservation scientists have been cleared of research misconduct by the University of Tasmania after a review sparked by complaints from logging industry representatives. Chinese investment in Australia plunged by 61% last year, new data shows. But according to one researcher, this may be more about changed foreign investment settings than a strained economic relationship. Thousands of Victorians may have missed out on early cancer diagnoses during the pandemic, potentially allowing the disease to progress past the chance of recovery and causing a \u201ccancer spike\u201d later on, the Cancer Council says.    Updated at 11.02pm GMT  ", "Victoria Covid cases drop below 50 for first time since June as NSW records four \u2013 as it happened [2020-09-07T11:00:34Z]": " \n  11.49am BST  \n Where things stand \n  \n  Thanks for following our live coverage of the coronavirus coverage in Australia. You can continue to follow our rolling global coverage here. \n  A quick recap on what happened today: \n   \n   More than 40% of all Covid-19 deaths in aged care in Victoria occurred in just 10 facilities. \n   Victoria recorded 41 new cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, of which eight were in aged care. It\u2019s the first time cases have dropped below 50 since 28 June. \n   NSW recorded four new cases, including three healthcare workers. \n   Queensland recorded two new cases, including another case among healthcare workers at Ipswich hospital. Western Australia recorded one new case, in a returned traveller in hotel quarantine.  \n   Victorian premier Daniel Andrews defended the tough restrictions in the lockdown roadmap, saying \u201cthese numbers are coming down, this strategy is working\u201d. The chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, defended Victoria\u2019s contact tracing system saying it was \u201cnot substantively\u201d different to that in NSW. \n   Andrews told 7.30 he was not concerned about the potential impact of Covid-19 measures, and the hotel quarantine inquiry, on his political future. \n   Prime minister Scott Morrison said the Victorian roadmap was \u201ccrushing news\u201d and criticised Victoria\u2019s contact tracing capacity, saying that \u201cunder the thresholds that have been set in that plan Sydney would be under curfew now. Sydney doesn\u2019t need to be under curfew now\u201d. \n   Morrison said he would wait to see what further economic support Victoria offered before making any announcement on income support, and said the extended lockdown would have a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on the budget. \n   Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has criticised the federal government\u2019s management of aged care during the pandemic, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t get the impression that anybody was stepping up and taking responsibility\u201d. \n   And the Business Council of Australia has called for the Victorian modelling to be released in full. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.04am BST  \n Andrews: 'Politics has never mattered less to me' \n  \n  Asked if he would step down as premier if the hotel quarantine inquiry laid the blame for the outbreak on his office, Andrews said his responsibility was to keep going. \n   \n   My position and the responsibility I have is to see our state through this. What is what I\u2019m focused on.  \n   Let me be as frank as I can be: Politics has never mattered less to me. Leadership is not able doing what\u2019s popular, it is about doing what\u2019s right.  \n   \n  He is only interested in one fight. That\u2019s right, the fight with the virus. I\u2019m assuming we all finish the second half of that phrase by this point. \n  Andrews continued: \n   \n   The politics of this, that is of no value. The only thing that matters is we all stay the course. We all keep following the data, the science and the doctors and get this done. Then move to the biggest economic repair job that our state has ever seen. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.00am BST  \n  \n  Rowland suggested Victoria\u2019s contact tracing system clearly wasn\u2019t fit for purpose at the start of the second wave, and still isn\u2019t. \n  Andrews said there was \u201ca lot of commentary being run\u201d. \n  Some of that commentary is by epidemiologists. \n  Andrews said: \n   \n   As the person who\u2019s here on the ground with a very detailed understanding of the amount of work that a team of 2,600 committed people are doing, let me say that we are getting to almost 100% of every positive case within 24 hours. There will always be a handful of people who are not home, can\u2019t be found, where they perhaps would be thought to be. We are getting to literally 100% of all close contacts within 48 hours. \n   They are national benchmarks. We haven\u2019t made our own rule book here. We are absolutely delivering against the nationally agreed thresholds. We report those in a proper way, open, transparent way. We\u2019re always looking for improvement, though. \n   \n  Andrews was asked if he would release the full modelling and said he was \u201calways happy to release as much information as we can\u201d.  \n  I am sure a number of reporters will follow that up with him at tomorrow\u2019s press conference. He continued: \n   \n   With the greatest of respect to all the people that you have just quoted and potentially many more \u2013 there are many different opinions in the medical and research community. \n   \n  He said that the line had to be drawn somewhere.  \n   \n   Ultimately this is not an academic exercise. It is about getting to the other side of this, opening up, safe, steady, staying open. \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.53am BST  \n  \n  Rowland asks if Andrews has modelled how many businesses will go under in these restrictions. \n  Andrews said there was \u201cno question that there is significant pain and there is a real challenge there\u201d. \n   \n   We will have more to say about business support. This is about saving lives and it is also about saving livelihoods, because the point here, Michael, is the notion of spending the rest of this year and pretty much all of 2021 bouncing in and out of lockdowns every four weeks or so \u2013 there can be no economic recovery until we deal with the health issue. We have to do this in a sequential, logical way. That is the plan we\u2019ve outlined. \n   \n  So, did you model how many might go out of business? \n   \n   There is a whole lot of modelling. In terms of trying to be definitive that is challenging. We have to meet all the targets that we have laid out. We need to have more to say and we will soon about the business support that we will offer. \n   \n  Andrews said his government would spend \u201cthe next week or so consulting in a very detailed way with different sectors to craft a package of support that, in their [the business community\u2019s] judgement, meets their needs\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  10.49am BST  \n It's not 'valid' to compare the outbreak in Melbourne to cases in Sydney, says Daniel Andrews \n  \n  Victorian premier Daniel Andrews tells Michael Rowland on ABC 7.30 that Victoria could not be compared to other states, because there was \u201ca set of unique circumstances\u201d applying to this state. \n  Those unique circumstances are high rates of community transmission. \n  Asked about prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s comment that if NSW had the same thresholds in place as set out in the Melbourne roadmap, Sydney would be under a curfew now, Andrews said: \n   \n   I don\u2019t think it would be. Sydney has not had the amount of community transmission we\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly valid comparison, and not a worthwhile one.  \n   We\u2019re not in New South Wales. We have got a set of unique circumstances that apply to Victoria and a roadmap to safely and steady ease out of these current rules, these current restrictions, to find a Covid-normal, to open up and stay open.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.52am BST \n \n \n  10.24am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews will be interviewed on ABC 7.30 at, well, 7.30pm. We\u2019ll bring it to you live.  \n  \n \n \n  10.06am BST  \n More than 40% of aged care deaths in Victoria occurred in just 10 homes \n  \n  For weeks, the federal government has refused to disclose the aged care homes in Victoria where the most deaths occurred. However, Guardian Australia obtained the list on Monday, and it reveals more than 40% of deaths occurred across just 10 homes.As of Monday, 532 of the state\u2019s deaths were linked to aged care, with St Basil\u2019s Home for the Aged in Fawkner recording 44 of those deaths. The home, which caters for the Greek Orthodox community, is where the most deaths have occurred.Epping Gardens Aged Care had the second-highest number of aged-care deaths in the state, at 35. Kalyna Care, a residential home in Delahey, was third, recording 22 deaths. Twin Parks Aged Care in Reservoir and Kirkbrae Presbyterian Homes in Kilsyth both recorded 20 deaths, and Baptcare Werribee and Mecwacare Hoppers Crossing both recorded 18 deaths. Meanwhile, four facilities each recorded 17 deaths: Glendale Aged Care in Werribee, Estia Health Ardeer, Japara Sunbury and Bupa Edithvale.In total, 228 deaths occurred across the 10 homes, with the figures current as of 10am Monday.On Monday, the state department of health confirmed Guardian Australia\u2019s figures were correct. The federal department of health is yet to comment. \n   \n    Related: Revealed: more than 40% of Victorian coronavirus aged-care deaths were residents in just 10 homes  \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.58am BST  \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, was on ABC drive in Melbourne earlier today defending the roadmap. You can listen to the full thing here, but the following is a bit of a summary. \n  Sutton told host Rafael Epstein that it is possible that Melbourne could move through the stages earlier than outlined, if we hit the case targets earlier than predicted. Conversely, \u201cit could go longer. I don\u2019t think it will go longer\u201d. He says we are \u201cabsolutely on track,\u201d presuming everyone keeps following the rules. \n  Asked whether the target numbers will change, Sutton says they will always look at the daily epidemiology to see \u201cwhether there\u2019s an approach that allows for easing in another area or allows us to move to the next step even though we technically haven\u2019t got below a certain threshold\u201d. \n   \n   If it\u2019s zero mystery cases and zero sporadic cases... but one or two cases that are entirely known in a controlled and contained setting then I think we would judge it on its merits at the time.  \n   \n  Sutton said the rules are designed on the assumption that compliance with the rules will be \u201cpretty high\u201d.  \n  In response to criticism from Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott, who said there had been no transmission at Bunnings, Sutton said you \u201csimply can\u2019t know that\u201d. \u201cSome of them probably have been,\u201d he said. \n   \n   When a case is being interviewed by our contact tracers and they say \u2018I have been here and there and to Bunnings,\u2019 we don\u2019t go back to Bunnings and say \u2018did you know that someone who has come through your store and a dozen other places has coronavirus?\u2019 We wouldn\u2019t report that back because it\u2019s not a definitive source of transmission, it\u2019s one of many possibilities. \n   \n  This seems very different to the approach taken in places like Queensland, where an itinerary of everywhere a positive case has visited is released to the public when a community case is identified.  \n  Despite that, Sutton said there is \u201cnot substantively\u201d a difference between contact tracing standards in NSW and Victoria. But he says NSW has not had a week where it\u2019s had to trace 3,000 cases, and that Victoria was \u201cprobably overwhelmed that week\u201d. \n  He says that NSW has probably been able to identify 100% of its cases, which Victoria has not, because of the numbers involved. Asked about prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s criticism that if Victoria had better contact tracing it would not need to lock down, Sutton said that\u2019s a \u201cconvenient misinterpretation\u201d. \n   \n   We are doing contact tracing at a level akin to NSW, Queensland and most places in the world right now. If we could do some kind of fantasy contact tracing where someone got a test and you could contact them within 12 hours because of the turnaround time fo the test, the notification to the department, and our contact tracing all happened within a matter of hours, we would step up a level, but o one is doing that anywhere in the world. \n   \n  Sutton said Victoria\u2019s benchmark is to contact people within 24-hours. He says the difference between Victoria and NSW is that Victoria has untraced community transmission, which is, by its very name, harder for contract tracers to work with.  \n  On the figure of fewer than five cases a day before 26 October, Sutton said that is based on the modelling. He said that figure also includes the assumption that there\u2019s no more than five mystery cases in the proceeding fortnight.  \n  Epstein asked Sutton what he would say to people who don\u2019t support the restrictions. He said:  \n   \n   I think the really core deniers, if you like, people who will never be convinced by peer-reviewed evidence or by an expert, and I don\u2019t necessarily put myself in an expert in the sense of a virologist or infectious disease physician... if people aren\u2019t convinced by evidence-based informing policy I am not sure I\u2019d shift them. \n   \n  I think the question was broader than just the hard-core denialists \u2013 there are people who question the roadmap who aren\u2019t denialists, but anyway. \n  Finally, Sutton was asked how he could know that the roadmap would not cause more harm than it would prevent. \n   \n   I don\u2019t think we can know in absolute terms because it is based around probabilities. \n   \n  But he says that avoiding the worst outbreak Victoria has avoided \u201cthousands and thousands of deaths\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  9.30am BST  \n  \n  The parliamentary committee into the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelter has abandoned plans to hold in-person hearings on country in Western Australia. \n  The committee had intended to meet on the land of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people this month, but according to AAP, those meetings will no longer go ahead in person. \n  The decision could be revisited in the unlikely scenario WA\u2019s restrictions, which limit arrivals and require those entering to quarantine for 14 days, are eased later this year. \n  No dates have been locked in for future hearings, which are likely to be held via teleconference. \n  The committee chair, coalition MP Warren Entsch, had previously thanked WA treasurer and Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, for approving their travel plans.  \n  \n \n \n  9.26am BST  \n  \n  Prof Peter Collignon, a former advisor to the World Health Organisation, said that questions remained over whether Victoria had worked quickly enough to identify and stop the spread of Covid-19 in workplaces, and what specific measures had helped reduce that spread. \n  He told Melbourne bureau chief Melissa Davey that it was possible that harsher lockdown measures like the curfew may have been avoided had the targeting of workplaces been more effective. \n  Collignon said: \n   \n   A lot of transmission was in essential workplaces and in low-paid jobs where workers were moving from working place to workplace, and targeting those issues in future will be more effective than broad-brush, blunt approaches. \n   The curfew doesn\u2019t do much to stop transmission; it just makes it easier to police other measures. If you take away people\u2019s normal lives, like the ability to go outside, you need the reasons for it. \n   Now, we know people are in fact safer outside exercising than inside in a crowded home. Some of the suite of things introduced in Victoria have a harsher effect than others and we must try to justify those harsher measures especially. That means asking: \u2018How much difference did this measure make?\u2019 \n   \n  Read the full report here. \n   \n    Related: Victoria warned it must zero in on best measures to avoid another coronavirus shutdown  \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.58am BST  \n  \n  It remains deeply weird to see the Melbourne CBD so empty.  \n  No buskers, no crowd of people waiting six-deep for the route 86 and 96 trams in the Bourke Street mall. \n  \n \n \n  8.36am BST  \n Business council 'extremely concerned' that Victorian modelling has not been released \n  \n  Speaking of the Victorian modelling, the Business Council of Australia has called for it to be released in full.  \n  As I just said, what has been released is a government report on the modelling, not the full report. And as we should all know by now, six months into the pandemic, modelling is not prescriptive. \n  Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott says: \n   \n   Business is extremely concerned that Victoria\u2019s very restricted recovery roadmap is based on modelling that has not been released. \n   Eminent epidemiologists have raised important questions about the assumptions that are underpinning Victoria\u2019s plan. \n   The authors of the modelling themselves have described the modelling as a guide, and we understand it\u2019s a challenge to model, but that\u2019s why we need transparency of data and sharing of information. \n   We want to understand how the Victorian modelling is going to drive decisions, what it is based on and how it is going to work. We are calling for the modelling to be released so business can work with the state government to make sure we can create Covid-safe workplaces and get the economy open faster. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.32am BST  \n  \n  The following graphic has been posted on the official Facebook page of Daniel Andrews. \n   \n   \n    Daniel Andrews has put the following graphic on his Facebook page, saying it explains why tough restrictions must remain in place until Victoria gets to very low levels. pic.twitter.com/max5wTLfYe\u2014 Calla Wahlquist (@callapilla) September 7, 2020\n    \n   \n  The accompanying post said: \n   \n   If we removed the \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 restrictions when daily case numbers were averaging 25, there\u2019s more than a 60 per cent chance we\u2019d be back in lockdown by Christmas. \n   When the stakes are so high, it\u2019s a risk we just can\u2019t take. \n   The modelling also shows that if we drive daily numbers down to five before taking the next step \u2013 that likelihood drops to just 3 per cent. \n   \n  The modelling as released to the media was not particularly detailed, and epidemiologists told us that it was based on very conservative assumptions. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a thing that should be taken into account when you look at what the modelling shows.  \n  \n \n \n  8.20am BST  \n  \n  Please take a break to look at this baby numbat\u2019s tiny feet.  \n   \n   \n    Today is National Threatened Species Day and is a day to raise awareness of animals at risk of extinction - like the orphaned wild numbat babies currently in our care. \u2800With some TLC and time to regain their strength, we aim to release the numbats back into the wild. pic.twitter.com/2zULVjZjoj\u2014 Perth Zoo (@PerthZoo) September 7, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.09am BST  \n  \n  Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business of Australia, Peter Strong, said that there had been \u201cno consultation\u201d by the Victorian government with the business community on its restrictions roadmap, describing the consultation which did take place as \u201cjust a box ticking\u201d. \n  Strong said the NSW government, in contrast, had been holding weekly \u2013 now fortnightly \u2013 meetings with the small business and retail sector since March. He told ABC24: \n  We have been trying to consult with the Victorian government months ago and we have just met silence. \n   \n   The state is being run by one person, that is the impression I\u2019m getting. I hope I am wrong, but I get the impression he is not talking to his cabinet ministers because if he had spoken to people he would have a proper plan that was communicated in a way that we understood, that fitted in with the way business works and with Christmas.  \n   There will be an awful lot of people that have a very bad Christmas as a result of this. \n   \n  Strong said the consultation in Victoria was \u201cpretend consultation\u201d. \n   \n   It is just a box ticking and we are not being listened to, otherwise they would not have come up with the dates they came up with. \n   \n  Would be wrong of me not to add here that, without undermining the economic and emotional toll on small businesses, there will be many people facing a very bad Christmas, and having a very bad time right now, because they have lost a loved one due to Covid-19. \n  \n \n \n  8.02am BST  \n  \n  The final comment Turnbull made was about Rio Tinto\u2019s destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site, a rock shelter in Juukan Gorge.  \n  Turnbull said he \u201cfound the whole thing completely staggering\u201d. \n  Which, for a former prime minister and former environment minister, who held the former role during the unpicking of the mining tax and the carbon tax and therefore would be intimately familiar with the mining lobby in WA, is interesting. \n  I don\u2019t know anyone else with any familiarity with the iron ore industry in WA who was shocked by the destruction of that special place. And Rio Tinto\u2019s own internal meetings show they were not anticipating any real backlash beyond a possible injunction. \n  Because this is, as Guardian Australia has reported extensively, pretty commonplace.  \n  Turnbull said:  \n   \n   I just honestly, I don\u2019t understand how it could possibly have happened. I mean... When I was environmentMinister, I listed the Burrup Peninsula which has some of the most ancient rock art in the world on it, some really extraordinary images there... And you know, this heritage is so important, it is so unique, it is so Australian, and it has to be, it should be treated with the greatest respect.  \n   I just don\u2019t... To be honest, I have no idea how this could possibly have happened. I have no idea what went wrong in Rio Tinto, what went wrong with the WA government or whoever the consent authority was, to allow it to happen, it just staggers me. \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.55am BST  \n  \n  Turnbull said the story about his old rival former prime minister Tony Abbott working with the UK government on trade was \u201ca bit of a beat-up really\u201d saying Abbott only had an \u201cunpaid advisory role to their board of trade, which is essentially the trade minister and a couple of other senior ministers\u201d.  \n  I haven\u2019t seen that he is not going to be negotiating trade deals or representing Britain. Obviously a former Australian prime minister, if he was representing another country, that would be awkward to say the least. \n  He then suggested Abbott could have another crack at public office. \n   \n   I wonder whether Tony might regain his UK citizenship, which he could do in an instant because he was born in the UK, and run for the House of Commons, because there might be a conservative constituency that would endorse him. But you know, there have been quite a few examples of this over the years, of Australian politicians then going back to the United Kingdom and serving in the parliament.\u201d \n   \n   \n   Turnbull said this was not a prediction, but then said Abbott \u201chas got a sort of a view of the Anglo-sphere which sort of ... perhaps ... you know, would make that more suitable for him. \n   Karvelas pointed out that the British media, and even conservative British politicians, have been prepared to call Abbott a homophobe and a misogynist. \n   \n  The Australian press are not so forthright, and Abbott\u2019s former political colleagues are also reticent, as Turnbull showed when Karvelas asked if he would describe Abbott by those terms. He said: \n   \n   Well look, I wouldn\u2019t want to put labels on him other than \u2013 well, he has put a few nasty labels on me over the years I might say, so I won\u2019t return the compliment \u2013 but I would just say, Tony has got very ... reactionary views, I think, on women\u2019s role in the world. \n   We don\u2019t need to go through them, we all know what his publicly stated views are.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.07am BST \n \n \n  7.48am BST  \n  \n  Turnbull said the federal government should have ploughed ahead with the planned legislated increase for superannuation, and that the tone of the debate, with people (mainly from his former party) saying that people should retain control of their own money, is \u201call a bit patronising\u201d. \n   \n   I think the compulsory occupational super has been a great achievement in Australia, and I think we should support it.  \n   \n  He reminded host Patricia Karvelas that when he was prime minister he opposed efforts to allow superannuation to be used to pay house deposits. Readers may recall that Turnbull\u2019s advice to first home buyers was to get a loan from their parents. \n  He said that people should not be encouraged to chip away at their retirement funds.  \n   \n   I don\u2019t agree with the measure to allow $40,000 to be taken out of people\u2019s super. These are desperate times, and governments have two make decisions very quickly but I think frankly, with the benefit of hindsight, that will be seen to have been a poor quality decision. \n   \n  He said that young people who withdraw superannuation funds now are robbing themselves of compound interest, and will end up with \u201ca lot less\u201d when they retire. Coalition politicians who say you can build your super up later overlook that point, he said.  \n   \n   So you have$40,000 in your super, right, that will compound over time as your investments grow to become a much larger amount. If you spend it all now, and then you have to start from scratch, it will take you along time to catch up. I mean, this is not rocket science... \n   I wonder whether it wouldn\u2019t have been better to provide more, you know, more targeted support from government because basically, I mean, Paul Keating made this point and it is a fair point, that what was happening was that people mostly on lower incomes were raiding their savings, their legislated superannuation savings to fund current expenditure. And look, there is a libertarian argument that says no-one should be obliged to put money into super, there are plenty of people in the Liberal Party that agree with that. I think it [super] has been a great Australian achievement, and I think chipping away at it is unfortunate. \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.40am BST  \n  \n  Turnbull said he was \u201cvery surprised there wasn\u2019t a very thorough plan to deal with aged care facilities,\u201d adding that the coronavirus risk in those facilities was \u201cnot something that has come out of left field\u201d.  \n   \n   It deserved a lot more thorough, rigorous thinking in advance. It may well have had that, but it hasn\u2019t been communicated.  \n   It easy to criticise, and I think it is important for us to be critical, because we have got to learn from these events, but generally, Australian governments have handled this pretty well. I live in Sydney as you know, our state government, led by Gladys Berejiklian has done an outstanding job, and Sydney has got \u2013 it\u2019s a big city, a lot of density, a big cosmopolitan city, a lot of people coming and going \u2013 it\u2019s got all of the risk factors, is filled with risk vectors or infection vectors as anywhere in Australia, and yet she has managed so fa, to keep the virus suppressed. And it is a huge credit to her, she deserves a lot more credit and recognition for what she has done. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.43am BST \n \n \n  7.37am BST  \n  \n  Turnbull then clarified that it would be \u201cunfair to single Richard Colbeck out\u201d, adding that the aged care minister is \u201ca friend of mine\u201d. \n  The former prime minister drives an equal-opportunity bus \u2013 many people can fit under the wheels. \n  He continued:  \n   \n   This is a whole of government issue ... This is not exactly a sort of niche issue that has just been dealt with by a minister without much oversight or involvement from the cabinet or the prime minister.  \n   This was a front and centre issue, so yes, Richard is the minister, but everybody in the government should have been very alert to this issue, the health minister, the prime minister, everybody, state governments as well, even though it is a federal government responsibility.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.45am BST \n \n \n  7.34am BST  \n Malcolm Turnbull slams federal response to outbreaks in aged care \n  \n  Turnbull criticised the Morrison government, and the aged care minister in particular, for its handling of the pandemic and failure to take responsibility for things like systemic failures in aged care. There are, he said, \u201cplenty of efforts to blame-shift\u201d. \n   \n   Well, I didn\u2019t notice the federal government, the standing federal minister, standing up and saying, \u2018We are absolutely responsible for all of the problems in aged care. We are absolutely responsible for the failure to, for example, develop a plan to deal with the nursing homes, aged care premises, following Newmarch House.\u2019 \n   There are two incidents or events which I think should have been big wake-up call to everyone. The first one was the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, and following that, the [cruise ship] industry should have been shut down. It was obvious that cruise ships have everything wrong about them from a Covid point of view. The wrong demographic, people in confined \u2013 gathered together in close proximity, they were, as people said, floating petri dishes, and we took too long to bring that to a halt.  \n   And it is pretty obvious that aged care premises, facilities, were going to be a very serious problem, and they have proved to be everywhere in the world. And I don\u2019t get, I didn\u2019t get the impression that anybody was stepping up and taking responsibility for that, particularly after Newmarch House demonstrated the nature of the problem. But again ... Politicians rush to good news and flee from bad news generally.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.40am BST \n \n \n  7.30am BST  \n  \n  On state borders, Turnbull said no federal politician could tell Western Australia what to do. \n   \n   I don\u2019t think there is a lot of evidence to suggest that a more liberal approach to the borders in Western Australia would result in a dire health outcome, but ultimately that\u2019s a decision that has to be taken by the government of Western Australia.  \n   There is nothing more, and I learned this over many years in politics ... there is nothing that Western Australians have less time for [than] someone sitting on camera telling the Western Australian government how to run that huge state. Forget it.  \n   You can make a few gentle suggestions, but ultimately, that state government has its own sovereign responsibilities and it is entitled to exercise them, and it is a Labor government, but it is a very capable government led by Mark McGowan. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.34am BST \n \n \n  7.27am BST  \n  \n  Malcolm Turnbull said Andrews had no alternative to further lockdowns and that the federal government was playing political games. Which, of course. \n   \n   There is a lot of politics in this obviously, and you can never exclude [that], expecting politicians not to be political is a little foolish. Given that where they started, with those very high infection rates, the question is: what should they do differently where they are now?  \n   \n  Turnbull said there was \u201ca lot of blame to go around\u201d for the outbreak in Victoria and how it occurred, but that the question which should be asked of Scott Morrison was: \u201cWhat would you suggest Dan Andrews should do differently right now?\u201d  \n   He also said there was no point complaining about the difficulties of overriding the views of various state and territory governments in the federal system, saying \u201cas Christian Porter often used to say, complaining about Australia\u2019s federation is like complaining about Switzerland\u2019s mountains\u201d.  \n   \n   There are overlaps, and there are plenty of opportunity for people to duck the irresponsibilities and blame others for things that they ought to be getting on with. The Australian people, in my experience, are really impatient with that, and they find nothing more irritating than politicians who try to shirk off their responsibilities. \n   So in terms of managing the pandemic itself, per se, the principal responsibility is obviously with the state governments and territory governments who have the relevant health departments and they have made decisions about lockdowns and relaxing or not relaxing those lockdowns are.  \n   Aged care is a federal government responsibility, no question about that. The borders are a federal government responsibility and have been since 1901. There are some areas that are clearly federal and others that are state, but generally, people expect the state and federal governments to work together and cooperate, but you have seen plenty of cases where state governments and state premiers have decided that they will take a more draconian approach to border closures than the feds would like, and have been rewarded with enormous endorsement from their people.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.32am BST \n \n \n  7.13am BST  \n Malcolm Turnbull won't criticise Daniel Andrews \n  \n  The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is on ABC News 24 and said he would not join in criticism of the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews. \n   \n   I am very reluctant to join in everyone else criticising Dan Andrews. He has a very difficult job, and managing the pandemic is hard for everybody. Clearly, the infection rate got out of hand, and they are reeling it back in.  \n   The truth, however, is that Gladys Berejilian\u2019s government in New South Wales has been more effective in containing it, and suppressing \u2013 although not eradicating \u2013 the virus, but it is a very slow and long haul, and I hope that Dan Andrews will in \u2013 and I\u2019m sure he will, in a practical way \u2013 review and revisit his schedule as time goes on, so that in the light of new developments, he may be able to accelerate the reopening, because as you know, it is a very hard, tough time for Victorians.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.17am BST \n \n \n  7.08am BST  \n  \n  The outbreaks with the highest number of active cases in Victoria are: \n   \n   Frankston hospital \u2013 19 cases. \n   Vawdrey Australia truck manufacturer \u2013 14 cases. \n   Bulla Dairy Foods in Colac \u201316 active cases. \n   Dandenong police station \u2013 11 active cases. \n   Royal Melbourne hospital Royal Park campus \u2013 10 active cases. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.18am BST \n \n \n  6.57am BST  \n  \n  The Victorian health and human services department says the 14-day average daily case number in Melbourne is 84.8, and regional Victoria is 5.3. \n  The daily average number in Melbourne needs to be below 50 by 28 September for the metropolitan region to progress to the second step of the roadmap, which will mean more industries can go back to work and people can gather in groups of five (from two households) outside. \n  The average numbers also explain some of the frustration of regional Victorians: they can\u2019t go to stage three, with no restrictions on reasons to leave their home but some gathering limits, until the average is below five statewide.  \n  \n Updated at 7.06am BST \n \n \n  6.51am BST  \n  \n  The Greens in Victoria have responded to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria\u2019s call for its members to refuse to negotiate rent reductions, saying that it should be illegal for landlords to refuse good-faith rent reduction negotiations during the pandemic. \n  The party has written to the Andrews government urging them to amend the Covid-19 commercial and residential tenancies legislation amendment (extension) bill, which is before the Legislative Council, to make refusal illegal.  \n   The Victorian Greens acting spokesman on local government, Sam Hibbins, said:  \n   \n   The [institute\u2019s] advice is an abuse of power and would result in tenants already struggling with housing and financial stability being pushed over the edge. \n    The government must now step in to prevent landlords and agencies wilfully refusing or delaying good faith negotiations with tenants to reduce rent.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.58am BST \n \n \n  6.46am BST  \n  \n  The federal member for Indi, Helen Haines, is \u201cdisappointed that the roadmap to reopening regional Victoria shows little change in the short term\u201d. \n  She says she will write to premier Daniel Andrews about the issue. \n   \n   \n    \u201cOur friends and family in Melbourne are doing it really tough and our heart goes out to them and the sacrifices they are making\u201d @helenhainesindi \u201cBut rural and regional Victoria is currently in a very different environment\u201d #auspol @SBSNews pic.twitter.com/vdpOSgKqHt\u2014 Brett Mason (@BrettMasonNews) September 7, 2020\n    \n   \n  Haines says: \n   \n   As a former health worker, I know how important it is to stop the spread. I appreciate how difficult it is for the premier to balance so many interests. \n   But his announcement has made it clear that we\u2019re looking at months, not weeks, until we can reopen. After drought, bushfire and border closures, regional Victorians would welcome the opportunity to re-establish our economy quicker than the current plan allows.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.50am BST \n \n \n  6.41am BST  \n  \n  It\u2019s Calla Wahlquist here.

Including but not limited to, operating via appointment only, split shifts, perspex screens, cashless payment, temperature checks, disposable masks and face shields.\u201d \n   \n  As anyone who has got a tattoo knows, tattoo studios stunk of Dettol and latex gloves even pre-pandemic.

Let\u2019s see how the system copes without our cooperation.\u201d \n   \n  The institute is also calling on the government to allow one-on-one private inspections by appointment.  \n  Later on Monday, REIV issued a call for the Andrews\u2019 government roadmap to undergo an independent review.  \n  \n Updated at 6.12am BST \n \n \n  4.44am BST  \n Qld premier updates health minister's Covid figures \n  \n  It appears Steven Miles didn\u2019t have the most up to date statistics during that earlier press conference.  \n  There are fact 27 active cases in Queensland right now (earlier he said 25). \n  Two new cases were announced in Queensland today. \n  The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, posts this updated infographic: \n   \n   \n    Monday, 7 September \u2013 coronavirus cases in Queensland:\u2022 2 new confirmed cases\u2022 27 active cases\u2022 1,133 total confirmed cases\u2022 971,209 tests conductedSadly, six Queenslanders with COVID-19 have died. 1,089 patients have recovered.#covid19au pic.twitter.com/poiWvewa1X\u2014 Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) September 7, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.48am BST \n \n \n  4.38am BST  \n  \n  The Australian small business and family enterprise ombudsman believes small businesses should not have to pay costs associated with permanently closing down as a result of the continuing lockdowns in the state.  \n  Kate Carnell is calling on the Victorian government to cover the costs.  \n  Carnell said: \n   \n   Under the Victorian government\u2019s roadmap, many small businesses will not be able to open for another eight weeks at least, and that\u2019s only on the condition that there is [fewer] than five cases per day as a statewide average.  \n   On that basis, small businesses that were thinking this lockdown would only last for another couple of weeks now don\u2019t know if they will ever be able to reopen. \n   For those struggling small businesses that know they cannot remain viable under these imposed conditions, the Victorian government needs to step up and help them make the sensible business decision to exit. \n   This means the Victorian government needs to pay for all break-lease termination fees \u2013 not just on the premises but also equipment so small business owners can walk away without further penalties.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.41am BST \n \n \n  4.24am BST  \n Queensland records two new Covid-19 cases \n  \n  Queensland\u2019s deputy premier, Steven Miles, has announced two new Covid-19 cases.  \n  He said the first is a woman in her 20s, a household contact of a known case. The second is a woman in her 30s and is a further healthcare worker at the Ipswich hospital.  \n  There are 25 active Covid-19 cases in Queensland. \n  Miles said health authorities had tested 662 people at a pop-up clinic on Russell Island after a woman on the island was diagnosed with coronavirus at the weekend.  \n  \n Updated at 4.29am BST \n \n \n  4.21am BST  \n Formals and graduations in NSW to go ahead, Covid-safely \n  \n  Some more information on that earlier announcement that year 12 formals and graduation ceremonies will go ahead in New South Wales.  \n  Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the events can be done in a Covid-19 safe manner.  \n   \n   We will always rely on the health advice, which recommends Covid-safe formals and graduation ceremonies take place from 12 November after the final HSC exam. \n   Students are currently preparing for the HSC and deserve to have events to look forward to after their exams.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.23am BST \n \n \n  4.06am BST  \n  \n  The press conference has now finished. \n  \n \n \n  4.06am BST  \n  \n  Health minister Greg Hunt was asked about vaccine concerns, especially from within the multicultural community.  \n  This question follows a recent letter from religious leaders opposing the use of cell lines from an aborted fetus in the Oxford vaccine, one of two the government announced support for today. \n  Hunt said he is meeting with church leaders this week, but also stresses the University of Queensland vaccine, the second one the government is backing, does not have the same cell base.  \n  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have that origin, and so any concerns at all which have been raised are completely dealt with from the very basis of the University of Queensland molecular clamp,\u201d he said.  \n  \n \n \n  4.01am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison reiterated a call to see the assumptions the Victorian roadmap was based on, particularly to gauge how efficient the modellers thought the state\u2019s contact tracing system is.  \n  Earlier he said the government could provide further support to the Victorian contact tracing effort, as he said he hoped the restrictions could be eased more quickly. \n  \n Updated at 4.18am BST \n \n \n  3.59am BST  \n Victorian roadmap will have 'negative impact' on budget, says PM \n  \n  Scott Morrison acknowledged the Victorian roadmap would have a \u201cnegative\u201d impact on the federal budget announcement next month.  \n   \n   Treasury will obviously have to take that into account as they finalise their projections once again, as they had to do for the recent economic statement. So I think that is fairly obvious.  \n   It\u2019s certainly not going to have a positive impact. It\u2019s going to have a negative impact. It\u2019s actually going to impact on employment and on incomes, on revenues, and all of these things.  \n   We will be now in a position to sit down with industry and businesses, particularly obviously in Victoria, but let\u2019s not forget that there are domino impacts because of the role that Victoria plays in our national economy through supply chains about how that can flow on into other states and territories.  \n   So, sure, the impact zone of what has been announced yesterday in Victoria is very much obviously, and terribly sadly, in Melbourne and Victoria more broadly. But there will be ripple effects of this announcement yesterday that will impact other parts of the country.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.04am BST \n \n \n  3.50am BST  \n Contact tracing capacity vital, say epidemiologists \n  \n  On contact tracing, Scott Morrison said the commonwealth can provide more resources to Victoria, including ADF personnel, to help match NSW\u2019s levels.  \n   \n   If they need extra Services Australia support, we\u2019ve already had ADF support in there, but I think if there is extra support that is needed to lift whether it\u2019s in Victoria or, indeed, in Queensland or Western Australia or Tasmania, if this is what is preventing the easing of restrictions, then I think it is about matching the level of capacity against what is happening in NSW \n   And I should stress, it\u2019s just not about how many people you\u2019ve got on the phone. Information systems are critical to this. The way work is structured and organised is critical to this. And it\u2019s an integrated tracing capability.\u201d \n   \n  The health minister, Greg Hunt, also has some quotes on hand from epidemiologists who\u2019ve spoken up about the importance of contact tracing for Victoria over the past 24 hours.  \n  Hunt said:  \n   \n   Prof Tony Blakely, from the University of Melbourne, an author of the modelling, subsequently said: \u2018If we do our contact tracing better than we did three months ago, the contact tracers may be able to hold the case count without it going up again as badly as our model suggests.\u2019 \n   Professor Peter Collignon from the Australian National University in Canberra: \u2018A lot hinges on contact tracing. So far, Victoria has not been able to do that as well as other states. I think actually a more nuanced approach like NSW is doing where very good contact tracing is likely to be sustainable over the long-term.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.04am BST \n \n \n  3.44am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison will wait to see what economic support the Victorian government introduces before announcing further relief specific to Victoria.  \n  Morrison was asked how he could justify slashing jobseeker and jobkeeper at the end of the month to Victorians who have been banned by their state government from going to work. But he did not acknowledge the cuts, instead pointing to how the government had extended their timeframe.  \n   \n   Jobkeeper is a national program. Jobkeeper is a program that is as important in Cairns as it is in Cronulla or, indeed, in anywhere else in Melbourne or Western Australia. Different states will draw on that in heavier amounts as Victoria is now. And they will be drawing heavily on this over the balance of this year and, I would think, into next year.  \n   The situation we have in Victoria is very specific to Victoria, and I\u2019m seeking to see what the Victorian government will be doing in taking actions to mitigate the economic impact of the decisions the Victorian government has made regarding the restrictions and the plan that they have set out.  \n   When it comes to specific economic support income support or other forms of support that they consider is appropriate to deal with the consequences of the decisions the Victorian government is taking, I\u2019ll be looking to see what they\u2019ll be doing first before the commonwealth considers any responses that we\u2019ll be making.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.47am BST \n \n \n  3.36am BST  \n Morrison: Victorian roadmap 'crushing news' \n  \n  Scott Morrison hopes restrictions in Victoria can be eased more quickly than outlined in the state\u2019s roadmap on Sunday.  \n  He appeared to criticise the level of caution in the plan, and said he would work towards boosting contact tracing capacity for Victoria to enable it \u201cto move in a more confident way than I think the plan that was announced yesterday set out\u201d. \n  He also pointed out how Sydney would be under curfew if it followed the Victorian government\u2019s thresholds for case numbers, declaring \u201cSydney doesn\u2019t need to be under curfew now\u201d. He heralded New South Wales\u2019 \u201cgold standard\u201d for tracing capability, and said Victoria should aim for this level.  \n  Earlier today, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton rejected this comparison with Sydney, arguing Victoria required harsher rules because of its higher community transmission rates.  \n  Morrison said:  \n   \n   The announcement that Victorians would continue to live under curfew and be under these restrictions for many months, if not just weeks in the most harsh of those restrictions, of course is crushing news. \n   The plan that was outlined yesterday, I hope, is a worst-case scenario. I see it as a starting point in terms of how this issue will be managed in the weeks and months ahead in Victoria. We will continue to carefully review this plan. We\u2019re yet still to receive the detailed modelling. We\u2019ve seen the high-level modelling and the other assumptions that have gone into the plan.  \n   But what I can\u2019t help but be struck by is that, under the thresholds that have been set in that plan, Sydney would be under curfew now. Sydney doesn\u2019t need to be under curfew now. They have a tracing capability that can deal with outbreaks. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s important that we work on building that tracing capability in Victoria.\u201d \n   \n  Morrison also said the government does not have the authority \u201cto step in and tell the Victorian government they have to follow another plan\u201d, adding \u201cit is incumbent upon us to work constructively with the Victorian government\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.48am BST \n \n \n  3.24am BST  \n \"Sovereign capacity to get Australians what they need\" \n  \n  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, health minister, Greg Hunt, and health department secretary (and former chief medical officer) Brendan Murphy are speaking about the $1.7bn vaccine deal for two promising projects: one from Oxford University and one from the University of Queensland. \n  Morrison said: \n   \n   Australia needs some hope today. Particularly in Victoria, they need some hope today. And so that is what we\u2019re here to deliver today. \n   That is giving us a sovereign capacity to get Australians what they need ... home-grown sovereign plan for vaccines is the hope I bring to Australians today.\u201d \n   \n  Morrison notes the Oxford vaccine is at a more advance stage, but said the promise of the UQ vaccine \u201cis giving us a sovereign capacity to get Australians what they will need should both of those vaccines prove successful as they go through their trials\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.35am BST \n \n \n  3.13am BST  \n  \n  On contact tracing, Daniel Andrews says the ambitious infection thresholds set for easing restrictions are not set so low because contact tracers can\u2019t handle higher loads.  \n   \n   It is absolutely an acknowledgment that this is wildly infectious and \u2013 just imagine this for a moment. So you bump that threshold up to 10 or 15 cases, \u2018cause that\u2019ll get us there quicker. Then literally, moments later, the case numbers start to tick up.\u201d \n   \n  Brett Sutton said: \u201cIt\u2019s true that neither restrictions are a substitute for contact tracing, and contact tracing is not a substitute for restrictions where they\u2019re required.\u201d \n  Sutton also said that despite the threshold set for zero community transmission to move to a \u201cCovid normal\u201d stage of minimal restrictions, he said the step could be taken even if there were days of one or two cases among other days of zero cases.  \n   \n   Whenever you see jurisdictions that are in the ones and twos that have days of zeros and they\u2019ve got international travel closed off, then they almost invariably get to the point of zero transmission. So if we\u2019re there, it\u2019ll be pretty clear that we can take the next step.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.22am BST \n \n \n  3.01am BST  \n  \n  I\u2019m hearing that Scott Morrison press conference we mentioned earlier has been slightly pushed back, probably closer to 12:15pm now. \n  \n Updated at 3.05am BST \n \n \n  2.58am BST  \n PM 'addicted to spin', Labor's Chris Bowen says of vaccine deal \n  \n  The federal opposition has welcomed the vaccine agreement with AstraZeneca but says it vindicates Labor\u2019s criticism of Scott Morrison for announcing it prematurely. \n  Labor\u2019s health spokesman, Chris Bowen, said the prime minister was addicted to spin. \n   \n   This is what the prime minister told Australians he had done three weeks ago when he hadn\u2019t yet done it.\u201d \n   \n  Bowen said the government would have Labor\u2019s support to enter into more of these types of agreements. He noted that there were no guarantees about which vaccine candidates would be successful.  \n  Bowen said the effectiveness of vaccines was assessed by clinicians, not politicians. Vaccines were rolled out in Australia once signed off by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and \u201cthat\u2019s as it should be\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.02am BST \n \n \n  2.57am BST  \n  \n  Some big news for 17-year-olds: \n   \n   \n    #BREAKING: Year 12 School Formals &amp; Graduation Ceremonies will be allowed to go ahead in Term 4. @9NewsSyd\u2014 Liz Daniels (@lizziedaniels) September 7, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.57am BST  \n  \n  Asked about business groups expressing frustration at the details of the announcement, Daniel Andrews said \u201cwe have done as much as we possibly can\u201d. \n  He also said discussions began on Sunday about further business rescue packages which will be introduced \u201cas quickly as we can\u201d and \u201cmay vary one sector to the other, may vary in terms of time liveness, [and] might need different support at different times\u201d. \n   \n   There\u2019s 100,000-plus people going back to work quite soon that, and the mix of that and how that will work in very practical terms has absolutely been informed by very detailed discussions.  \n   I know there are a lot of businesses, a lot of sectors, a lot of peak bodies who did not get the news they wanted yesterday. I understand that.  \n   Again, I\u2019ll be really clear about this. It\u2019s not just about profits. There are people as well. They\u2019re concerned about all those things. If we could have provided a different series of steps, more things opened faster and done that safely, then, of course, that\u2019s what we would have done.  \n   We will continue this week, for instance, to consult with a very wide range of stakeholders, a very wide range of businesses, particularly those who are worst affected by these necessary steps and the safe and steady nature of them. \n   \n  Andrews also rejected accusations his government failed to consult with business leaders ahead of releasing the roadmap, saying the government had made \u201cliterally thousands of phone calls\u201d to gain feedback.  \n  \n Updated at 3.05am BST \n \n \n  2.48am BST  \n  \n  Premier Daniel Andrews was asked about the use of artificial intelligence to assist contact tracing and help health authorities understanding of the virus\u2019 spread. \n  He said AI has already been in use, mostly \u201clooking back at interviews [contact tracers speaking to cases] that were conducted some time ago, trying to find patterns from even a week or a month ago\u201d.  \n  \u201c[It] might be instructive in terms of what we could face next week,\u201d he said. \n   \n   There\u2019s a culture of continuous improvement. I don\u2019t think even artificial intelligence will necessarily find us six hours, but even if it finds us 30 minutes, or if it finds us a connection that wasn\u2019t necessarily obvious to us, then that\u2019s a good thing.  \n   I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out in the weeks and months to come if there\u2019s some other product or if there\u2019s some other change, whether it be high-tech or low-tech, that we can do to make contact-tracing even better again, we would absolutely do.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.53am BST \n \n \n  2.43am BST  \n AHPPC not consulted on Victoria's roadmap \n  \n  Brett Sutton has defended remaining in the harshest level of restrictions to contain Covid-19 in the state, saying \u201cfrom a public health point of view, stage 4 has driven down transmission much more substantially than stage 3 even with masks was doing\u201d. \n  He said moving to stage 3 earlier would have meant \u201ca very slow road\u201d back to normalcy.  \n  He also said Victoria\u2019s roadmap was not discussed with the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee before its release \u201cbecause no one\u2019s got a view of the Victorian industry and population and epidemiology to the extent that we do ourselves\u201d. \n   \n   Obviously the principles of getting that effective reproduction down as low as possible and driving transmission down to levels where we know that we can sustain in the long term is something that has been spoken of at AHPPC.  \n   I\u2019ll be updating them in a couple of hours on the roadmap to talk through it and to have reflections from them in terms of how they see it and any other advice they\u2019d give. We\u2019re always open to those conversations.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.17am BST \n \n \n  2.37am BST  \n PM due to hold press conference at noon \n  \n  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is due to address the media in Canberra at midday. \n  He will be joined by the health minister, Greg Hunt, and the health secretary, Prof Brendan Murphy, to discuss the vaccine agreement and the response to Victoria\u2019s roadmap \n  \n Updated at 2.40am BST \n \n \n  2.36am BST  \n  \n  Responding to a question about where in the world has zero community transmission been achieved (a threshold which has been set out in Victoria\u2019s roadmap to reach \u201cCovid Normal\u201d), Brett Sutton said: \n   \n   It\u2019s been achieved across the other states and territories of Australia. \n   There are only so many island states in the world and you have to have closed off international travel to even make it an aim.  \n   So you know that\u2019s not something being pursued across North or South America or Europe or much of Asia. It\u2019s a possibility in those entirely closed-off countries, if you like. So New Zealand has pursued it. Taiwan has pursued it and they have been successful in that regard. Iceland is another example.  \n   But it\u2019s not even feasible for countries, you know, like European countries, where free movement of people is ongoing. They wouldn\u2019t want to try to pursue it.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.39am BST \n \n \n  2.31am BST  \n  \n  Brett Sutton has said the date for easing restrictions on 28 September will need to be \u201clocked in\u201d. \n  However, he left the door open for further restrictions to be eased earlier than expected, including the 26 October stage when the curfew and stay at home restrictions are planned to be eased.  \n   \n   I think we would always go through a process of review that we wouldn\u2019t say different circumstances shouldn\u2019t lead to a relook at how we\u2019re tracking and the risk of moving to a different stage. I think the clarity is important but I think everyone would welcome an earlier opening rather than a later one. I just don\u2019t want to, you know, be giving that promise in advance of knowing how we\u2019re tracking. \n   We\u2019ll have opportunities for people to meet others. We\u2019ll have small outdoor gatherings that allow people to see others, not just for exercise purposes, but for other recreational purposes. I hope people focus on making the most of that, but recognising that going beyond that does increase the risk and it does put everything at risk in terms of what the next step might be and getting on top of these numbers.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.36am BST \n \n \n  2.26am BST  \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, has given some details on 14-day daily averages.  \n  He said: \n   \n   For regional Victoria it\u2019s only just above five. So I would expect in the two weeks from now, it will absolutely drop below five, all things being equal, and without significant outbreaks occurring. \n   For metro Melbourne, that average in the last 14 days has been close to 100, but we have to consider that it was close to 400 only a month ago. So that continues to trend down and, again, in the two weeks from now, we could expect it to be below 50 as a reflection of today\u2019s number. So absolutely heading in the right direction.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.34am BST \n \n \n  2.23am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews defends his continuing lockdowns, warning the state doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe luxury of letting our frustration get the better of us\u201d otherwise it risks a third wave. \n  He also thanked Victorians for seeing a reduction of 725 cases in one day last month, on 5 August, to 41 cases today.  \n   \n   I want to say how proud I am, despite the difficulties of the restrictions, the great challenge we face, the sense of frustration, the weariness with these rules, we are sticking together, we are looking out for each other and we are having considerable success. \n   These numbers are coming down, this strategy is working. We are bringing a sense of control to this and we\u2019ll drive these numbers down further, so that when we open up in safe and steady steps, we can stay open and we can be together again, we can have a sense of normality, but one that is lasting, one that can be defended, one that can be sustainable, one that can last throughout 2021 until we get a vaccine.  \n   These are difficult times, but to go from 725 cases to 41 cases in a month, that demonstrates to you that this strategy is working, the sacrifices that we are making, all of us, are worth something.  \n   I want that to count and that\u2019s why we simply can\u2019t open up as quickly as everyone would like us to, I would like to open up much more quickly than we can, but none of us have the luxury, none of us, not me, not any Victorian, has the luxury of letting our frustration get the better of us and simply saying, \u2018I so desperately want this to be over that I\u2019m going to pretend that it is.\u2019 \n   That\u2019s not a recipe for anything other than a third wave and being open, yeah, for a very short period of time and then being closed down again. That\u2019s not a strategy, that\u2019s not the advice, that\u2019s not what the data or the doctors recommend and, therefore, that is not an option that is available to us now. A steady safe opening is what we will do and it will be lasting.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.29am BST \n \n \n  2.13am BST  \n  \n  More on aged care: \n  Of the 1,781 active cases in the state, 873 are in aged care.  \n  There are 93 outbreaks in aged care facilities, which Daniel Andrews said \u201cis a number that\u2019s falling\u201d. \n   \n   There has been some stability come to residential aged care and we\u2019re very pleased that everyone is working together to drive those numbers down to as low as they can be, given the underlying vulnerability of so many residents in those settings.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.10am BST  \n Eight of nine Victorian deaths linked to aged care \n  \n  Daniel Andrews says that of the nine deaths announced today, eight are linked to aged care outbreaks. Of the deaths: \n  One female and three males in their 80s have died; one female and three males in their 90s have died; one female in her 70s has died. \n  There are 1,781 active cases in Victoria. Of those, 266 are being treated in hospital; 25 are receiving intensive care.

But he said the Victorian government was right to say that it would be irresponsible to ease restrictions too quickly.  \n  Victorians understood the need to proceed cautiously rather than allowing \u201csome sort of explosion [in case numbers] and have to slam the brakes\u201d on a third time. \n  \u201cI\u2019m not here to second-guess the decisions made by premiers one way or the other.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.51am BST \n \n \n  1.54am BST  \n  \n   \n   \n    \ud83d\udee3\ufe0fSteps towards COVID Normal: https://t.co/XKmHRQssyA  \ud83d\udcbbUpdated info &amp;

Both of them are showing promise. So we\u2019re getting ready so that Australia will be in the best possible position should either or both of those vaccines prove to be safe and effective.\u201d \n   \n  Ahead of an expected announcement today, you can read more on the vaccine news from my colleague Paul Karp. \n   \n    Related: Australian government announces Covid vaccine deals to provide 84.8m doses  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.43am BST \n \n \n  12.21am BST  \n  \n  Relief for businesses hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic will be extended until the end of the year.  \n  In a joint statement on Monday morning, treasurer Josh Frydenberg and industrial relations minister Christian Porter announced the temporary insolvency and bankruptcy protections, aimed at stopping businesses from folding, will now last until 31 December.  \n  The grace period had been due to expire in less than 30 days. \n  The statement said: \n   \n   Regulations will be made to extend the temporary increase in the threshold at which creditors can issue a statutory demand on a company and the time companies have to respond to statutory demands they receive. \n   The changes will also extend the temporary relief for directors from any personal liability for trading while insolvent. \n   The extension of these measures will lessen the threat of actions that could unnecessarily push businesses into insolvency and external administration at a time when they continue to be impacted by health restrictions. \n   These changes will help to prevent a further wave of failures before businesses have had the opportunity to recover.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.04am BST  \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s roadmap out of Covid-19 restrictions is \u201ca highway to hell\u201d for the accommodation sector, according to an industry body. \n  The Accommodation Association, responding yesterday after the roadmap was unveiled, has predicted \u201cbusiness closures and economic ruin\u201d, and said it wanted to work closer with the Victorian government \u201cto strike a better balance\u201d on restrictions.  \n  Dean Long, chief executive of the Accommodation Association, said: \n   \n   This so-called road to recovery is actually a road to business closures and economic ruin. With apologies to AC/DC, the Victorian government is in fact providing Victoria\u2019s accommodation providers with a highway to hell. \n   The Victorian government has a moral responsibility to support accommodation businesses with a $1,000 per room monthly payment to help offset fixed costs such as electricity, water, insurance while they continue to enforce a close down on our sector. \n   We also desperately need the federal government to extend the cashflow boost three to at least $100,000 per Victorian business.

Twenty-three per cent of respondents said they had live-streamed during lockdown, and 50% of these did so for the first time. \n  Australia is a nation of sporting fans, with 47% of those surveyed indicating they actively followed sports on a weekly basis. On average, sports fans spent nearly six hours watching sport per week prior to Covid-19. \n  The Deloitte digital media sector leader, Leora Nevezie, said without live sport, time spent watching sports halved to two-and-a-half hours per week, with the number of respondents actively following sport on a weekly basis dropping from 46% to 25%. \n  Without live sport, fans turned elsewhere to fill their time. Fifty per cent instead spent time keeping up with breaking news, 33% spent extra time with family and friends, 32% exercised, while 31% watched previously released shows and movies. \n  \n Updated at 11.31pm BST \n \n \n  11.11pm BST  \n  \n  For more on the business sector\u2019s response to Victoria\u2019s roadmap, my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes has filed this report. \n   \n    Related: Businesses will fold due to Melbourne lockdown being extended, chamber of commerce says  \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.07pm BST  \n  \n  Innes Willox, the chief executive of Australian Industry Group, has lashed the Victorian government\u2019s roadmap out of coronavirus restrictions. \n  He\u2019s said \u201cthe fury is palpable\u201d among the business community, and said outbreaks in aged care and healthcare settings should be handled without city- and state-wide lockdowns. \n  Willox told ABC Radio National: \n   \n   The point that business is saying is that with this roadmap there is no way it\u2019s going to be achieved in the timeframes that the government\u2019s proposing. To have zero cases for 28 days before we go back to normal. There\u2019s nowhere in the world where that\u2019s occurring.  \n   Victoria seems to have been settled out for some sort of weird social experiment here and quite frankly it\u2019s going to destroy lives and livelihoods and we\u2019re seeing that occurring now. \n   There are so many inconsistencies in this document it\u2019s not funny. why can a cabinet-making business be opened but a carpet-manufacturing business can\u2019t? it makes no sense. So we want some consistency, some clear timelines and some clear timeframes. \n   \n  Willox also called for the federal government to intervene to help Victoria\u2019s economy: \n   \n   I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any option but for the federal government to get the Victorian economy moving again. Victoria is going to be a basket case for years, there is going to be high unemployment, we have no migration coming in which has been a big driver of the economy in the past, no foreign students, another big driver.  \n   The city will be empty for another six months at least. Victoria is going to need all the help it can get to get back on its feet. It\u2019s sort of a rerun of the 1990s recession it\u2019s going to need a spark to get going again. And that\u2019s the disappointing thing is that the government in this so-called roadmap has put forward no ideas or no creative solutions about how to get Melbourne moving again. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.10pm BST \n \n \n  10.50pm BST  \n  \n  For those of you who still aren\u2019t across the details of Victoria\u2019s roadmap for easing Covid-19 restrictions, my colleague Calla Wahlquist has this report with everything you need to know. \n   \n    Related: Victoria's roadmap for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions: what you need to know  \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.44pm BST  \n Good morning \n  \n  Welcome to another week of Covid-19 coverage across Australia.  \n  Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton has acknowledged there is a risk of \u201clockdown fatigue\u201d, but said the alternative to continuing strict lockdowns is \u201ctoo awful to contemplate\u201d. \n  Sutton was speaking the day after premier Daniel Andrews unveiled the roadmap out of restrictions for the state, which will see several more weeks of curfews for the states, and predictions life in Victoria won\u2019t return to a sense of normal for some months.  \n  On fatigue, Sutton said: \n   \n   I know that it is a risk, and we all feel it. We\u2019ve all been subject to this. And some obviously have suffered more in terms of working livelihood and I understand that fatigue. But if there were an easier alternative, if we could just go back to a normal life now, we\u2019d be choosing that.  \n   These are difficult choices. There\u2019s no question. It is a hard road ahead and it is a slow and steady approach. But the alternative is too awful to contemplate, really, and I hope that people can hang on. But of course, there\u2019s a risk that there\u2019s fatigue. As long as people keep in mind that we will get there slowly and incrementally if we can drive this transmission down.\u201d \n   \n  Health experts have backed the extension of the lockdown, however some business groups have expressed frustration at the roadmap. Here\u2019s a report outlining the details of the roadmap.  \n  Elsewhere, the Morrison government has finalised deals to buy 84.8 million doses of two promising Covid-19 vaccines, if they prove successful. The $1.7bn agreement will see two vaccines, being developed by the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland, manufactured in Australia and provided free to all Australians. The first doses could be available by January 2021 if trials go well. \n  \n Updated at 10.52pm BST \n", "Victoria reports 149 new cases and 24 deaths as NSW records six infections \u2013 as it happened [2020-08-26T09:01:53Z]": " \n  9.49am BST  \n End of the day Wednesday 26 August \n  \n  That is where we will leave the live blog for this evening.

You know, I sit in the Senate every day with this bloke, and I tell you, Patricia, I would not trust the care of my parents to him. \n   \n  We have heard several Labor MPs (and Greens MPs) call for Colbeck to be sacked as aged care minister \u2013 but that went beyond that. \n  Wong is asked to elaborate and says: \n   \n   I genuinely do not believe this man understands what it is to be a responsible minister in the portfolio.  \n   I do not believe he is competent.  \n   I think, you know, we watch him in the Senate, talking about process and webinars and letters and talking, in circumstances where it is clear he has been \u2013 he has been warned by their own taskforce, by their own royal commission, and by the events in Australia in the sector itself this year.  \n   I mean, to suggest that the workforce, they didn\u2019t plan for withdrawal of the workforce, when we saw what happened in Newmarch House, is extraordinary. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.45am BST \n \n \n  7.27am BST  \n  \n  It sounds like the press freedom report is being tabled in the parliament. \n  Paul Karp is listening to that for you. \n  It will be available here, when it is tabled.  \n  \n Updated at 7.32am BST \n \n \n  7.25am BST  \n  \n  Penny Wong is now talking to Patricia Karvelas \u2013 she is asked about what Wang Xining said about the lack of consultation with the CCP: \n   \n   On the inquiry, I\u2019ve made quite a few comments, and I think it\u2019s important to distinguish between the what and the how. On the actual call for an inquiry, we made clear, in the context of a global pandemic, it is an entirely reasonable proposition to understand how it occurred, so we can prevent it happening again. So that was an entirely reasonable proposition. I did make the point that it would have been preferable, rather than Marise Payne announcing it on Insiders, that for there to have been some diplomatic work prior to the announcement, particularly with other countries who were supportive.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.32am BST \n \n \n  7.16am BST  \n  \n  Josh has an update on the CovidSafe app: \n   \n   \n    The federal health department is waiting on legal advice as to whether it can actually ask state health depts for information on how the Covidsafe app is going, due to the privacy restrictions. pic.twitter.com/QhbSNoFQN0\u2014 Josh Taylor (@joshgnosis) August 26, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.15am BST  \n  \n  Dave Sharma, a former ambassador, is being asked about Wang Xining\u2019s comments today, about the call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus and the original response being \u201churtful\u201d for the relationship. \n  Sharma tells Patricia Karvelas: \n   \n   I mean, I think we were quite careful not to single out China. I know other countries chose to do so. But we were very clear all along that we wanted to get to the origins and the causes of this outbreak.  \n   Now, it\u2019s a matter of public record that the first cluster of cases, as the Chinese deputy head of mission himself conceded, was in Wuhan, China. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a controversial proposition. That\u2019s well-known. And it was well-publicised at the time. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.31am BST \n \n \n  7.06am BST  \n  \n  So many shiny happy faces in QT today. \n  (To be fair, I look like a troll woken from hibernation too early. Day 789 of 2020 is hitting us all hard.) \n  \n Updated at 7.32am BST \n \n \n  6.51am BST  \n  \n  Prof Paul Kelly gives a very diplomatic answer to a question on the Wang Xining\u2019s earlier claim at the press club that the coronavirus may not have originated in Wuhan: \n   \n   The question of the origin of the virus hasn\u2019t been asked for a while, it was early on something of great interest.  \n   I am much more focused now on what\u2019s happening in Victoria, and what\u2019s happening around the world. It continues to be a global pandemic of massive proportions. Thousands and thousands people every day being affected, hundreds and hundreds of people around the world dying from this virus.  \n   So, right now, I\u2019m more interested in what we can learn about controlling the virus and particularly developments of vaccines and effective treatments, rather than where it came from.  \n   But you are correct, the Australian government is very interested and as a scientist I am very interested in the origins of this particular virus and what we can learn for the next time, if it happens again. \n   ...[Let\u2019s look at the facts] We know the first cases reported, those of the facts came from Wuhan, whether it was we hand will be a matter for the WHO lead team, who will investigate this, when it comes to happen, Australia has been very much at the forefront of asking for that particular independent look at the origin of the virus, and I\u2019m sure we will learn a lot at that time. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.20am BST \n \n \n  6.46am BST  \n  \n  Prof Paul Kelly: \n   \n   In terms of mental health, and Telehealth, that\u2019s obviously decisions about what happens to that into the future is a decision for government, not the AHPCC, but certainly the AHPCC, and the health professions more broadly have welcomed Telehealth, as have indeed people who have, as healthcare seekers, sought care through that mechanism.  \n   That\u2019s a decision of government that will be made over coming days, weeks, in relation to the future of Telehealth. Mental health issues are very clearly an important component of this pandemic.  \n   We know specifically in Melbourne and other parts of Victoria, this is a very hard time for them, in terms of mental health and well-being, that\u2019s why the government has actually put insubstantial funding, into mental health especially in Victoria, but also more broadly. Where Telehealth will fit as part of those mechanisms will be decided by government over the next period. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.20am BST \n \n \n  6.39am BST  \n  \n  Acting chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, is giving today\u2019s update: \n   \n   In Victoria, 149 new cases today, six new cases in New South Wales, one of those overseas acquired in hotel quarantine, and the other fives bill being investigated now. And that is all in terms of the Australian situation in new cases. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.20am BST \n \n \n  6.34am BST  \n  \n  The parliamentary joint intelligence and security committee report into press freedom is also due to be tabled this afternoon (it was slated for after QT). \n  \n Updated at 6.35am BST \n \n \n  6.31am BST  \n  \n  Home to Bilo have responded to the news Isabella and her mum Huyen have been released from immigration detention: \n   \n   The Home to Bilo team are overjoyed at the news that Isabella and her mum Huyen have been released from the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation (MITA) to be reunited with their father and husband Paul in Melbourne. \n   Isabella was Tharnicaa and Kopika\u2019s only playmate when they were detained in MITA and Huyen was a great support for Priya and Nades as they navigated the difficulty of parenting in detention together.  \n   The release of Isabella and Huyen shows just how easily this process can occur. While they will never get back the time wasted in detention, they will now have a chance to heal and live together as a family.  \n   This reminds us that if they can do the right thing for little Isabella and her mum, then we know that they can do the exact same for our family. \n   With the release of Isabella it now means Kopika and Tharnicaa are the only children remaining in detention in Australia.  \n   In learning the news Priya states: \u201cI\u2019m so happy to hear that Isabella, Huyen and Paul can live together as a family. They have had a very difficult time in detention, every day is hard in detention. But today is a good day for them. I am waiting in hope that the government will make a similar decision for my family, so we can rejoin our community in Biloela.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.21am BST \n \n \n  6.29am BST  \n  \n  At the National Press Club earlier today, Wang Xining, the deputy head of mission of China\u2019s embassy in Australia, argued that diplomatic channels between the two countries remained open, at least at the level of officials. \n  But he said there were \u201csome shadows\u201d over the relationship \u201cso we need to make our position much more clear in order to remove the shadows\u201d. \n  He played down talk of Australian ministers like Simon Birmingham and Marise Payne being unable to secure a phone call with their Chinese counterparts, saying he did not think the embassy in Canberra had received any requests for such a call \u2013 although he left open the possibility such requests may have been made via the Australian embassy in Beijing. \n   \n   I received a phone call from one of your ministers, several months ago, talking about a trade issue. If we receive a request, it will be done in a very diplomatic way, through diplomatic channel. \n   \n  After the National Press Club event ended, Wang fielded a few more questions from reporters, seeking to clarify the claim that no specific requests for calls had been made: \n   \n   My embassy has not received any requests recently ... We are waiting for the request of the government and it will be [handled] in a very diplomatic manner. \n   \n  Pressed on any such request would also be handled in a timely manner, he repeated the original formulation: \u201cIt will be done in a diplomatic manner.\u201d \n  He said China hoped the Australian side would work with us to create a good atmosphere for the relationship to grow. \n  \n Updated at 6.33am BST \n \n \n  6.27am BST  \n  \n  Victoria Health has also issued its official data: \n  In Victoria at the current time: \n   \n   4,116 cases may indicate community transmission. \n   3,488 cases are currently active in Victoria. \n   578 cases of coronavirus are in hospital, including 39 in intensive care. \n   14,572 people have recovered from the virus. \n   A total of 2,132,679 test results have been received which is an increase of 13,480 since yesterday. \n   \n  Of the 3,488 current active cases in Victoria: \n   \n   3,135 are in metropolitan Melbourne under stage 4 restrictions. \n   203 are in regional local government areas under stage 3 restrictions. \n   139 are either unknown or subject to further investigation. \n   11 are interstate residents. \n   Greater Geelong has 66 active cases, Bendigo has 23 active cases and Ballarat has six active cases. \n   \n  Of the total cases: \n   \n   17,026 cases are from metropolitan Melbourne, while 1112 are from regional Victoria. \n   Total cases include 8,906 men and 9,663 women. \n   Total number of healthcare workers: 2,799, active cases: 434. \n   There are 1,487 active cases relating to aged care facilities. \n   \n  Active aged care outbreaks with the highest cumulative case numbers are as follows: \n   \n   211 cases have been linked to Epping Gardens Aged Care in Epping. \n   195 cases have been linked to St Basil\u2019s Homes for the Aged in Fawkner. \n   169 cases have been linked to BaptCare Wyndham Lodge Community in Werribee. \n   159 cases have been linked to Estia Aged Care Facility in Ardeer. \n   138 cases have been linked to Kirkbrae Presbyterian Homes in Kilsyth. \n   120 cases have been linked to Cumberland Manor Aged Care Facility in Sunshine North. \n   118 cases have been linked to Twin Parks Aged Care in Reservoir. \n   113 cases have been linked to Outlook Gardens Aged Care Facility in Dandenong North. \n   111 cases have been linked to Japara Goonawarra Aged Care Facility in Sunbury. \n   109 cases have been linked to Estia Aged Care Facility in Heidelberg. \n   \n  In Victoria there are currently 50 active cases in residential disability accommodation: \n   \n   Total resident cases: 13; Total Staff cases: 37. \n   Active cases in NDIS homes: 39 (13 residents). \n   Active cases in \u2018transfer\u2019 homes (state regulated/funded): 11 (0 residents). \n   Active cases in state government delivered and funded homes: 0. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.35am BST \n \n \n  6.26am BST  \n  \n  There is a national Covid update coming up in the next few minutes. \n  We\u2019ll bring you any news from that when it starts.  \n  \n \n \n  6.18am BST  \n  \n  Over in the Senate, we\u2019ve just heard a rather interesting development in the case of Bernard Collaery, the former ACT attorney general on trial for talking about Australia\u2019s spying on its tiny, developing neighbour Timor-Leste during oil and gas negotiations.  \n  Collaery is fighting the allegation that he disclosed protected intelligence information and has subpoenaed documents from a bunch of agencies and entities, including Woodside, the operator of the oil and gas fields. \n  The Senate has just heard that the government, through attorney general Christian Porter, intervened in the case to stop Woodside documents going to Collaery before it could have a look. It was using powers in the National Security Information Act to determine whether any of the documents needed to be kept secret.  \n  \u201cHow is it possible that an energy company such as Woodside could be in possession of documents that could contain matters related to national security? Or is this simply the attorney further abusing the NSI Act?\u201d Patrick asked.Responding on behalf of Porter, Marise Payne, the foreign affairs minister, said the intervention was appropriate, reasonable, and not uncommon in such cases.She said the information in the Woodside documents may have included \u201cnational security\u201d information, which, under the act, includes material affecting international relations, including economic relations with foreign governments.\u201cIt was appropriate for the attorney-general to have an opportunity to consider whether to issue a certificate under the act, or whether any other formal application or claim ought to have been made in relation to any documents produced by Woodside,\u201d Payne said.\u201cThe application was allowed by the court. Ultimately Mr President, I would note to the chamber and to senator Patrick, that the commonwealth did not seek any protection orders and the documents were provided to the parties.We\u2019ll have more on this story shortly.  \n  \n Updated at 6.27am BST \n \n \n  6.17am BST  \n  \n  And question time ends.  \n  \n \n \n  6.16am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n  My question is addressed to the prime minister: Why won\u2019t the prime minister take full responsibility for the consequences of his $1.7bn cut to aged care which made older Australians worse off before the pandemic and left residents of aged care homes more vulnerable to the deadly Covid virus? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   Mr Speaker, once again, the leader of the ppposition comes forward and says there were cuts to funding to aged care. Mr Speaker, when funding goes up every year, that means there\u2019s more funding each year.  \n   When there\u2019s a cut to funding, Mr Speaker, it means there\u2019s less funding.  \n   Now, these issues may be beyond the wisdom of the leader of the opposition and his apprentice shadow treasurer, Mr Speaker, with the training wheels still on to understand these issues, Mr Speaker, \u2018The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\u2019. \n   ...When funding goes up every year by $1bn and more, that\u2019s a good thing.  \n   And Mr Speaker, that is what has been happening with aged care funding in this country. That\u2019s why the number of in-home aged care places has risen from 60,000 to more than 150,000, Mr Speaker, under our government, and will continue to increase. That\u2019s why the number of residential aged care places and funding for residential aged care places has increased under our government, Mr Speaker.  \n   That is why we have put in place the aged Care Quality Commissioner. That is why, Mr Speaker, we have continued to support reforms in the aged care sector and, in particular... \n   \n  Albanese interjects to ask for the question to be addressed. \n  Morrison continues: \n   \n   I couldn\u2019t have been more [clear the comments made by the leader] of the opposition, [are] exactly the same misleading remarks made by the previous leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker. He probably did it with more credibility than this one, but what is true is that the government has been increasing the funding for aged care, as I and the health minister in response to many questions today have been able to demonstrate to the House and the Australian people.  \n   There is more funding, Mr Speaker.  \n   There is more funding and more than $1bn in additional funding to go to the Covid-19 response, that why, despite there being, extreme and severe impact on four facilities in Victoria, Mr Speaker, and a new march, and Dorothy Henderson Lodge, which, compared to what happened in Victoria which was even worse in Victoria in those four centres, it was unacceptable and the government has made that very clear. I have issued an apology in relation to those four facilities and that is what is called taking responsibility.  \n   What the leader of the opposition does seem to have as a blindspot to what is happening in Victoria, he seems to be the only person in this country thinks there has been no community outbreak of the coronavirus in Victoria, and that that has had an impact right across Victoria, which has got people locked up in their homes at the moment, and under severe stress and strain as a result of what has occurred in Victoria. We have worked hard to mitigate the impact on the aged care centre. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.29am BST \n \n \n  6.10am BST  \n  \n  Yup \n   \n   \n    \"Mr Speaker, whether it's public, private or not-for-profit is not the issue,\" the PM has told parliament, responding to Russell Broadbent's intervention.

If the prime minister won\u2019t listen to Labor and won\u2019t listen to his own royal commissioners, will he at least listen to his own backbench and acknowledge that his cuts of $1.7bn have contributed to the problem? \n  That is in relation to this story from Murph: \n   \n    Related: \u2018Disaster waiting to happen\u2019: Liberal Russell Broadbent lashes governments over aged care  \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n    I note the comments made by the leader of the opposition referring to the comments by the member for Monash. Mr Speaker, the member for Monash \u2013 like, I think, all members of this place \u2013 feels passionately about the care that is provided to elderly Australians.  \n   He has been passionate about that for as long as I have known him, Mr Speaker. From my very first speech in this place, my maiden speech as we sat together on those opposition benches alongside the member for McMillan, as he was known then, Mr Speaker \u2013 I\u2019ve always known him as someone who speaks his mind and to speak passionately in our party room, and he will always stand up for his constituents in his community, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been returned to this place, I believe, on so many occasions.  \n   In fact, Mr Speaker, back in 2017, he raised many of these issues \u2013 in fact, stood down from two parliamentary positions in relation to the way that he believed that his issues needed to be addressed.  \n   This was a significant factor, I can tell you, Mr Speaker \u2013 that after I became prime minister, because of the many times I\u2019d heard Russell Broadbent get to his feet, I believed we needed to have a royal commission into aged care.  \n   Mr Speaker, I know that the member for Monash...was very pleased to see the fact that we introduced that royal commission into aged care. The member for McMillan said successive governments over 30 years, Mr Speaker - he refers to as the failings in aged care \u2013 over 30 years, Mr Speaker.  \n   And he knows that. And his comments reflect the frustration he has had over a long career in this parliament.  \n   And the challenges we have to deal with in aged care address and will need to address, Mr Speaker, failings over a long period of time by governments of all persuasions. And these failings have occurred in private sector operators, not-for-profit operators, and indeed public sector operators.  \n   In fact, the royal commission followed the terrible events that we saw at the Oakden aged care facility in South Australia, Mr Speaker, which was a publicly run facility. Mr Speaker, whether it\u2019s public, private or not-for-profit is not the issue.  \n   What the issue is is ensuring that we get the funding to where it needs to be done, that we can continue to train the workforce and continue to lift the standards, and ensure the clinical training is there so that people who are in aged care facilities get the care and the dignity and respect that they deserve.  \n   That is something that the member for Monash and I agree passionately on together. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.17am BST \n \n \n  6.02am BST  \n  \n  Exceptionally normal behaviour from a government MP, personally saved from a pre-selection dumping by at least two prime ministerial interventions. \n   \n   \n    Coalition MP Craig Kelly gives a speech in Parliament about hydroxychloroquine and puts it on Facebook, now Pete Evans shares it with his 1.5 million followers. pic.twitter.com/Dn3Q6zopfH\u2014 Luke Henriques-Gomes (@lukehgomes) August 26, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.00am BST  \n  \n  Ken O\u2019Dowd once again learns what his very burning question for the minister is, at the same time we do. \n  Keith Pitt, continuing his love of wide striped ties, tells us O\u2019Dowd is known as the \u201cmember for coal\u201d. \n  I know some other names for O\u2019Dowd from people on the ground, but my oma raised me better than that.  \n  \n Updated at 6.09am BST \n \n \n  5.58am BST  \n  \n  Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: \n  The government\u2019s report on the deadly Covid outbreak at Newmarch House said families reported weight loss, dehydration, pressure sores and increases in urinary tract and skin infections amongst fragile residents.

First, the limitations of the aged care workforce had been well documented in reports such the 2018 report of the Aged Care Workforce Taskforce. 22 The sector is understaffed and lacks nurses with clinical skills;  \n   b. Secondly, it was widely reported that, in both Europe and North America, residents in nursing homes were dying in large numbers as a result of Covid-19;  \n   c. Thirdly, the Interim Report of this Royal Commission in October 2019 revealed a range of problems that beset the sector including workforce challenges, governance problems and the challenges associated with the interface between the aged care sector and the state health systems; 23 and  \n   d. Finally, individuals like Professor Joseph Ibrahim and organisations such as the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF), had raised their concerns about the sector\u2019s lack of preparedness for Covid-19 and offered solutions. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.12am BST \n \n \n  5.53am BST  \n  \n  Given the prime minister keeps referring to how he called the royal commission into aged care (while also disputing the \u2018assertions\u2019 the counsel assisting the commission has made) it is also worth remembering that he only called the commission, after months of reporting of how terrible aged care standards were in some homes, which was then knocked out of the park by a Four Corners series on the issue. \n  It wasn\u2019t out of the goodness of his heart. It was in response to a call that had become too loud to ignore.  \n  \n \n \n  5.51am BST  \n  \n  Labor has asked aged care minister, Richard Colbeck about Liberal MP Russell Broadbent\u2019s comments in Guardian Australia that aged care is a \u201cdisaster waiting to happen\u201d because \u201cprofit became more important than care\u201d and that he had warned the government but was \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d. \n  Colbeck replied: \n   \n   Mr Broadbent has a perspective on how he believes the aged sector should be structured. I respect his perspective. From the late 90s there were changes in the sector, and the opportunity for different forms of providers to come in. I respect his perspective. But governments since the late 90s have continued on a path where a range of provider types: government providers through states, community based, for profit and not-for-profit providers. We wanted a forensic inspection of the entire aged care sector, which is why the prime minister called a royal commission. We look forward to recommendations including about the structure of the sector. \n   \n  \u201cI don\u2019t concede the government has ignored or dismissed Broadbent\u2019s concerns,\u201d Colbeck added, citing the ability of any Australian to make a submission to the royal commission \u2013 an opportunity senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has taken up to raise concerns. \n  In the final supplementary, Labor asked how many more aged care residents might still be alive if Colbeck\u2019s warnings were heeded. \n  Colbeck replied:  \n   \n   I think it\u2019s really unfortunate that Labor seeks to make the correlation it does between the circumstance of Covid-19 and other discussions that are being undertaken. It\u2019s very, very unfortunate seek to make those correlations. I take very seriously the views that Mr Broadbent has made, I believe the government is taking them into account by conducting a royal commission. Every single one of the deaths [in aged care] is an absolute tragedy, I don\u2019t make the correlations [Labor] do for political purposes. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.13am BST \n \n \n  5.47am BST  \n  \n  Vince Connelly\u2019s latest dixer performance appears to channel \u2018baby discovers it has hands, and is transfixed\u2019. \n  Two stars.  \n  \n \n \n  5.43am BST  \n  \n  Greg Hunt is laying out how the aged care budget is increasing year on year. \n  Which it is. \n  Because more of the population is getting older.  \n  \n \n \n  5.40am BST  \n  \n  Peter Dutton is apparently filling out birthday cards for constituents while sitting in question time. \n  Happy Virgo season.  \n  \n \n \n  5.37am BST  \n Two-year-old girl released from immigration detention in Melbourne \n  \n  Back to Victoria for a moment: \n  A two-year-old child who has spent her entire life in immigration detention in Melbourne has been released with her mother.  \n  Isabella Lee Pin Loong had lived at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation centre since her birth. Her mother, Vietnamese woman Huyen Thu Thi Tran, sought asylum in Australia by boat in 2011 and has been detained for almost three years.  \n  Isabella\u2019s father and Huyen\u2019s husband, Paul Lee, lives in the community.  \n  Isabella and Tran left the detention centre on Wednesday afternoon after Tran was issued a bridging visa.  \n  Tran\u2019s lawyer Alison Battisson described the release as \u201cabsolutely extraordinary\u201d and \u201can incredible event to happen\u201d. \n   \n   The family can actually start their lives together as a family. Isabella\u2019s never lived with her father and Huyen\u2019s never really had the support of a partner [in raising her].  \n   Isabella can finally interact with friends and just have some normal run-of-the-mill childhood experiences. \n   \n  The only other children in detention are Kopika and Tharunicaa, part of the so-called \u2018Biloela family\u2019. Before they were taken to Christmas Island, the Tamil family was also held in the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation.  \n  \u201cThere is still a family detained on Christmas Island with two young girls who used to play with Isabella, so one playmate is out but two remain,\u201d Battisson said.  \n   \n   There are still many people in detention separated from their families, including their children. They should all have the same chance as Isabella now has to have a proper family life. \n   \n  Tran\u2019s bridging visa does not entitle her to stay in Australia permanently, but it does mean that she can live in the community for now. She had previously been assessed by the government as not engaging Australia\u2019s protection obligations, and was not able to challenge the decision in a court.  \n  The government had indicated its intention to deport her as recently as April, Battisson said.  \n  Isabella has not seen her father in person since March, when immigration detention visits were halted because of the coronavirus pandemic.  \n  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very overwhelming for Isabella in the beginning because she\u2019s never had proper interaction with the greater community,\u201d Battisson said.  \n  But, she said, \u201cthe difference for this young girl\u2019s life is actually life-changing.\u201d  \n  \n Updated at 5.40am BST \n \n \n  5.36am BST  \n  \n  So what else does the RMIT ABC fact check say on the aged care funding debate? \n   \n   The increase came despite a decision to pare $1.2 billion of \u201cefficiencies\u201d over four years, largely by reducing the subsidies paid to aged care providers to tackle potential over-claiming and an unexpected cost blowout. \n   The overall level of Commonwealth funding provided for aged care has increased on an annual basis for at least the past decade. \n   As experts noted, this result is hardly surprising, with Australia\u2019s ageing population leading to growing numbers of aged care recipients, increased care requirements, and higher care costs. \n   Analysis by RMIT ABC Fact Check shows funding has increased across a range of measures: in nominal dollar amounts, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation), as a proportion of total expenses, and as a dollar amount per aged care resident per day. \n   As some experts contacted by Fact Check suggested, rather than representing a cut, the decision to carve out $1.2 billion of \u201cefficiencies\u201d could rather be characterised as an attempt to better target aged care funding, with spending continuing to rise in real terms. \n   \n  So what does that mean? Overall it has increased. But money has been taken from some areas to fund others. \n  \n \n \n  5.34am BST  \n  \n  Julie Owens to Scott Morrison: \n   The productivity commission revealed older Australians with high-care needs in New South Wales are waiting almost three years for a Home Care Package. Did the prime minister\u2019s decision to cut $1.7bn from aged care leave these older Australians better, or worse off? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I\u2019ve already addressed the misleading statement that has been made by those opposite regarding funding, Mr Speaker. \n   (INTERJECTIONS) \n   What the ABC Fact Check actually demonstrated, Mr Speaker, on issues relating to where there was integrity matters within the Aged Care sector of overpayments, despite that, Mr Speaker \u2013 and those measures that the government introduced \u2013 the funding for aged care was increased by $1bn, Mr Speaker. \n   And has continued to be increased by $1bn \u2013 in fact, more than that \u2013 every single year. And one of the most significant areas, Mr Speaker, where we\u2019ve continued to increase funding, has been in the area of in-home aged care places, Mr Speaker. \n   And as I said before, in-home aged care places, under our government, has risen from around 60,000 when we came to government to over 150,000 now, Mr Speaker, and we\u2019re going to keep increasing those places as we go forward, as we did immediately after we received the interim report of the royal commission immediately putting a further 10,000 places into the in-home aged care network.  \n   Mr Speaker, we will keep increasing our funding in aged care, in residential aged care and in in-home aged care. I would invite those opposite to support those increases and the reforms that I believe will be necessary when it comes to aged care in the future just as, when we were in opposition, supported the Labor party as the shadow minister for emissions reduction will recall, when he worked with opposition members at that time to introduce important changes in aged care, I would hope that, when we deal with the royal commission into aged care, we might be able to deal with it in a similarly cooperative fashion, and that aged care not be used for political purposes. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.38am BST \n \n \n  5.29am BST  \n  \n  The Coalition has been in power for 14 of the last 20 years. \n  \n \n \n  5.28am BST  \n  \n  Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: \n  The aged care royal commission\u2019s interim report titled \u2018Neglect\u2019 drew attention to aged care residents sitting or lying in urine or faeces. Did the prime minister\u2019s decision to cut $1.7bn from aged care contribute to these shocking circumstances? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   Mr Speaker, I\u2019ve already addressed the misleading statements made by the opposition that they continue to assert, and I\u2019ve already informed the House of the significant increases in investments that have been made by the government when it comes to aged care. Mr Speaker, when I called the royal commission into aged care... \n   (interjections) \n   ..when I undertook that soon after becoming prime minister, Mr Speaker, I said to the Australian people that we would have to brace ourselves for some very hard information about how older Australians were faring when it came to aged care facilities in this country.  \n   And what we pointed out at the time \u2013 and what has been widely accepted, Mr Speaker \u2013 is that these challenges are ones that governments \u2013 our own, those that came before us \u2013 have been wrestling with for many, many years over many decades. \n   The things that the royal commission are looking at are not just issues and failings that have occurred in more recent times, but over the last 20 years.  \n   And what we have seen, as the aged care demands have increased on the system, they have increased not just in number, but in the nature of the care that has become necessary.  \n   And for those of us who have had to make decisions about putting our own family, our own parents, into aged care, we have known that, when we\u2019ve done that, we are putting them into pre-palliative care.  \n   And we know it won\u2019t be long, Mr Speaker \u2013 it won\u2019t be long, in many cases, Mr Speaker. \n   And it was certainly the case in my own experience, in the decision that my family had to make, that my brother and I and my mother had to make, when my father went into residential aged care. So I don\u2019t accept the interjections from those opposite, and I would ask them to show some respect..on this very personal, sensitive issue. Mr Speaker, when we make those decisions, we know \u2013 and the aged care sector knows \u2013 that they are having to deliver on a much higher level of acute care today than was the case 10 years ago or 20 years ago. \n   And that means the demands are greater. And that means the actions need to be greater. And that\u2019s why, Mr Speaker, our government has continued to increase funding in aged care every year by, Mr Speaker, more than $1bn every year.  \n   And we will continue to do that, and we will do more, and you will see more in the budget, and you will see more in next year\u2019s budget, just as people have seen in every statement now going back several years \u2013 increased places made available, particularly in in-home aged care. \n   It is a challenging area, Mr Speaker, and we must show respect and dignity for people who are living in residential aged care facilities, or wherever they\u2019re receiving our care. And that is our commitment to the Australian people. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.33am BST \n \n \n  5.21am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n  The aged care royal commission\u2019s interim report titled \u2018Neglect\u2019 revealed up to half of all older Australians in residential aged care are malnourished. They\u2019re literally starving. Didn\u2019t the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to cut $1.7bn from aged care leave frail and vulnerable older Australians worse off? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   The care and respect for Australians who are living in residential aged care is something that all members of my government \u2013 and I know that all members of this House \u2013 take very, very seriously.  \n   Very, very seriously, Mr Speaker.  \n   We have all had personal experiences, no doubt, of our own loved ones being cared for in residential aged care facilities, and we know how important it is. Mr Speaker, that is why our government has continued to increase funding for aged care.  \n   When we came to office after the 2012-13 budget, in terms of aged care places and funding, that was at 186,278 residential aged care places. In the most recent budget, that has increased to 219,000 places, Mr Speaker. \n   On in-home aged care places, we inherited just 60,000 places from those opposite and, in the 2019-20 budget, we have increased that to 150,756 places. In response to the royal commission into aged care, Mr Speaker \u2013 which I initiated not long after becoming prime minister \u2013 there was an interim report that was released, and it touched on three particular issues. \n   \n   \n   And we, Mr Speaker, responded to each and every one of those three issues highlighted in that interim report. With 10,000 Home Care Packages established at a cost of $496.3m \u2013 $25.5m to reduce the use of medication as a chemical restraint on aged care residents and at home. There was $10m for additional dementia training and support for aged care workers and providers, including to reduce their use of chemical restraints.  \n   And $4.7m to help meet new targets to remove younger people with disabilities from residential aged care. Mr Speaker, these were the matters that were highlighted in that interim report, and we moved very quickly to provide the funding to support that soon after that interim report came down.  \n   When its final recommendations are made next year, Mr Speaker, we will have the opportunity to respond in full to those in the budget of next year. In the meantime, in the budget of this year, we will continue to address the many challenges there are in aged care \u2013 not only the more than $1bn that we\u2019ve already put in to support our efforts to respond to Covid-19, but the other many issues that we continue to be aware of and have been acting on.  \n   In my earlier question, I ran through a series of funding commitments. Those funding commitments I outlined into the leader of the opposition\u2019s first question are only those that we\u2019ve announced, Mr Speaker, since the royal commission was established. So we\u2019ll continue to look after our older residents, and we\u2019ll do it in a way that ensures their dignity and their respect. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.28am BST \n \n \n  5.11am BST  \n  \n  In what might be the most cursed moment of this day, Barnaby Joyce invokes Michael McCormack to the despatch box.  \n  Joyce is EXUBERANT in his presentation of the question. \n  McCormack is doomed.  \n  \n \n \n  5.10am BST  \n  \n  Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: \n  Does the prime minister seriously deny he cut $1.7bn from aged care when page 172 of his 2015-16 MYEFO says about aged care funding, \u201cThe government will achieve savings of $472.4m\u201d and page 101 of his budget paper No. 2 for 2016-17 says about aged care funding, \u201cThe government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 bn\u201d? \n  Morrison: \n   \n   Thank you, Mr Speaker.

The Labor party have made these allegations before. In fact, it was the previous leader of the opposition who made the same allegations about a matter involving $1.2bn, Mr Speaker. And of all sources to actually agree the government \u2013 it may come as some surprise \u2013 but ABC Fact Check found that to be very misleading, Mr Speaker I table that for the benefit of the House, Mr Speaker.  \n  From that fact check: \n   \n   In Mr Morrison\u2019s first year as federal treasurer \u2013 that is, 2016-17 \u2013 total commonwealth funding for aged care (excluding the pension and other forms of income support for seniors, but including a range of other programs) was $17.4bn. \n   That represented an increase of more than $1bn over the previous year. \n   Did Scott Morrison cut funding from the aged care budget? \n   The increase came despite a decision to pare $1.2bn of \u201cefficiencies\u201d over four years, largely by reducing the subsidies paid to aged care providers to tackle potential over-claiming and an unexpected cost blowout. \n   \n  Morrison lists the government\u2019s spending and finishes with: \n   \n   Australia\u2019s record stands, Mr Speaker, in a position that other nations have not even approached.  \n   That\u2019s not to say, Mr Speaker, there have not been failings. Of course there have. There have been four cases in four facilities in this country where the outcomes have been completely and totally unacceptable, Mr Speaker, in those four cases. Mr Speaker, there have been a total of 16 cases overall where we\u2019ve had a significant impact.

We are not imposing anything on other countries.  \n   We are not trying to turn Australia into the People\u2019s Republic of China...we are not trying to replace your system with a presidential system. We\u2019re not asking Hungary Jacks to sell Chinese dumplings.  \n   You have your way to do things and let me say, sorry to keep you standing but I would like to say a few words about democracy because we don\u2019t believe democracy is a synchronic term. It must be a diacritical term because there has never been a single format of diplomacy all around the world and all along the history and all across the world. \n   Given my humble knowledge, I understand Plato in his time put aristocracy, democracy ahead of democracy.  \n   ...I don\u2019t believe the state of democracy whether seen before and after this country abandoned the white Australia policy. It is totally different. We need to take into consideration all the interests and components of diplomacy as well as elements.  \n   I\u2019m not in favour of replacing Western democracy with other type of democracy by saying mine is democracy and yours is not.  \n   I think it is a very narrow interpretation and it will democracy is a word and empty political slogan and a very outworn political cliche.  \n   Even for me, it is even sacrilegious for such a lofty idea of mankind.  \n   Secondly, I think democracy is not the end, it is the means. The end is the people. We need to ask the people whether you are satisfied with the performance of the system of a government that decides whether this democracy works.  \n   ...Look at how Chinese people live. Seven or eight months into this outbreak of Covid-19, our economy is picking up new momentum.  \n   The second quarter, the growth rate was 3.2%. Our trade registered positive growth in June and we have fabulous PMI and CPI numbers and also the schools are open, the bars are open and also the gyms are open so people are coming back to a normal life and they are able to join in a large crowd for a beer festival and a music festival without worrying about being infected again and if you look at some other countries claiming to be the lantern of democracy, the people suffer, people die and people are losing jobs.  \n   So that is why we see if a democracy fails to deliver to the people a qualified life and hope of future and sense of security, even if it is not a faked or failed democracy, it is not a democracy, it is underpar. That is my interpretation of democracy, thank you very much for your patience. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.32am BST \n \n \n  4.20am BST  \n  \n  Soft diplomacy. \n  (This would have been a whole episode of the West Wing, by the way, which is why the West Wing is also the worst.) \n  \n Updated at 4.25am BST \n \n \n  4.15am BST  \n  \n  Q:  \n  Just to clarify something you said earlier. Did the coronavirus, which is currently affecting the world, did it come from China, if it did, you talked about two or three other places, where could it have come from if not China?  \n  You talked about the feelings of the Chinese people, given their health has been affected and the economy trashed, do you understand that Australia\u2019s feelings might be heard, and the rest of the world, and they have the right to know where it comes from. \n  Wang Xining: \n   \n   Yes, I think it is up to the scientists to find out the origin, and also how it has been dealt with by different governments.  \n   I would like to call your attention to what has been said by Mr Michael Ryan. He is the Executive Director of WHO, health emergency program, he said recently that patient zero is not necessarily found among the first cluster of coronavirus cases.  \n   What I mean is, this time, this virus was first identified in China, and first reported in China. And we did what we could to provide to WHO and other governments what we have. In order to prevent further damage to other countries.  \n   But, you know, we are a country famous for strict discipline. So we managed to control the virus, if you calculate from the [beginning] of the year to April 8 when the lockdown of Wuhan was current, that signifies that the economy in China was basically under control.  \n   Roughly 100 days. It takes 100 days for another major country, for the cases to rise from zero to a million.  \n   So it is not the problem of the medical capacity of humankind. We are entirely able to do that. The problem is the way we treat this virus. And the efficiency of good governance and medical deployment. \n   \n  Q: To be clear, you are saying that it didn\u2019t originate in Wuhan? \n  Wang: We should leave the work to scientists. \n  \n \n \n  4.08am BST  \n  \n  On the CCP\u2019s rejection of Australia\u2019s original calls for an independent review into the origins of the pandemic, and the first response, Wang Xining says: \n   \n   It is very clear that the Chinese government and the Chinese people is opposed to that proposal about that international review, to understand this, you need to take this issue back to the context of late April.  \n   Firstly, we believe this proposal was targeted against China alone.  \n   During that time Australian ministers claimed that the virus originated from Wuhan province, they did not point to any other places as a source.  \n   We were singled out, we don\u2019t think it is fair.  \n    We believe the most authoritative and Institute is WHO, and it was criticised by Australian politicians.  \n   And there was blame on China for their failure to control the spread of the disease, and the sharp rise in cases, and try to shirk responsibility. The proposal came at a time when the US was trying to do that, so the proposal would help Washington to put more pressure on China.  \n   Firstly, the Australian government never consulted the Chinese government in whatever way before the proposal came out. We don\u2019t think it conforms to the spirit of comprehensive, strategic partnership. It lacks the least courtesy and diplomacy. But everybody needs to know the reason of this COVID-19.  \n   Chinese people also want to know, but the purpose to know the reason is not put blame on a place of people or authority when they were first identified, the purpose is to get people better prepared for a future medical outbreak, so that is why China supports wholeheartedly the WHO operation. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.50am BST  \n  \n  Wang Xining: \n   \n   At the early stage of this pandemic, people of Australia extended supporting hands and messages to the Chinese people.  \n   Friends in government departments, business, social organisations, helped China in sourcing protective equipment from international and foreign suppliers. When people were fleeing from China, there was still ... a determination to fly medical equipment into China.  \n   And reinforce the radio broadcasting with his Chinese colleague.  \n   They became heroes in Chinese social media. Later when there was an outbreak in Australia, Chinese health administration, PPE suppliers, and medical companies all rush to help.  \n   Despite sporadic reporting that distorted facts and discredited philanthropy, such as the so-called PPE holding by Chinese companies, most of our people demonstrated goodwill and exchanged warmth, sympathy, compassion, solidarity and friendship as fellow human beings in face of that killer virus.  \n   \n   \n   The third word is fairness. It is a social principle are traders ethic, and a market role. The trade growing between China and Australia could not have been achieved without fairness in place.  \n   A fair, open, non-discriminant policy, and regulatory environment that offers strongest market predictability, financial stability and legal reliability does enormous good to our business.  \n   There is no reason for our governments to revile from building such a complementary environment, a structure between China and Australia, giving our business natural impetus for trade and investment.  \n   China, after decades of market oriented economic reform has built a strong and competitive manufacturing capacity which covers all major industrial categories. Australia, as an OECD member, has achieved a business efficiency and sector profitability to top the world\u2019 list.  \n   The two economies fit each other. We could serve a classic case of comparative advantages. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.03am BST \n \n \n  3.44am BST  \n  \n  He continues: \n   \n   The second word is goodwill.  \n   We may disagree on some issues, and even disagree on how disagreements should be presented.  \n   But our partnership will not be wrecked by differences or disagreements as long as we reach each other well and approach all the issues with goodwill.  \n   Our differences may appear stark, but our commonalities at a human level far outweigh the discrepancy in structure. We both value life and family, we both cherish peace and stability.  \n   We both embrace equality, freedom, we both uphold justice and rule of law.  \n   Most importantly we both wish the other to live as aspired by choosing a methodology that we find fit and proper for ourselves. That is what we call goodwill.  \n   When we the people with goodwill are confronted with a different methodology, we do not panic, because we know that deep in our hearts, people hold dear the same value.  \n   The methodology will work only in good conditions and survive only with success. We the people do not wish other\u2019s evil, only because they have different understandings or interpretation of worldly methods or affairs.  \n   China is full of goodwill. China always wishes Australia peace and prosperity. We don\u2019t contest Australia over its domestic policy or safeguarding national interest and promoting Australian \u2018s well-being.  \n   We don\u2019t see Australia as a strategic threat. There is no fundamental conflict of interest or historical irritants to be healed. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.43am BST  \n  \n  Again, this does not seem to be a message to anyone in the room. \n  Rather, it\u2019s a message to those in this building watching this on screens. In the ministerial wing, would be my guess. But I\u2019m no expert on these things. \n  Wang Xining: \n   \n   We all know that China and Australia are different in many aspects. Length of history, roots of culture, size of population, future of economy, level of development, form of government, type of law system.  \n   Respect will anchor our relationship in the torrent of differences. The benchmark of respect between countries, in my understanding, is to follow the basic norms governing temporary international relationships.  \n   We should respect sovereignty and integrity, and refrain from interfering in others affairs. Respect others choice of social and political system and mode of development, and refrain from imposing 1\u2019s own idea onto the other.  \n   We should respect each other\u2019s legal system and rule of law, and refrain from interrupting the other\u2019s legal proceedings and undertakings. China respects Australia sovereignty.  \n   As China sovereignty was constantly under threat and disarray from external powers, the last thing China wants to do is to inflict on others what China suffered. Or to bully others as we were bullied.  \n   We do not deal in the result of such conduct. We reject it and will never engage in it. China does not interfere in Australia\u2019s internal affairs.  \n   Nor do we have any intention of changing Australia\u2019s political or social culture. The ... Chinese government respects the following of social conventions and contributing to local communities.  \n   Naturally China expects reciprocity in terms of respect. Which I believe should arise from better mutual understanding through conscientious academic study and social exchange based on genuine facts and objective analysis. Free from sway of political force or vested interest.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.39am BST  \n 'Respect, goodwill, fairness and vision' \u2013 principles to help Beijing-Canberra relationship \n  \n  Wang Xining mentions the elephant in the room \u2013 the rift: \n   \n   This partnership is no mirage on the sea.  \n   After centuries of interaction and association between our peoples, it is the result of decades of trust between our leaderships.  \n   But it is no easy task to keep a partnership in good shape. It takes concerted determination and joint effort to make it thrive. A married couple knows this. While a rift between husband and wife hurts one family, a rift between two countries hurts millions.  \n   I wish to propose for keywords as principles that may help to maintain and promote a relationship. Respect, goodwill, fairness, and vision. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.05am BST \n \n \n  3.35am BST  \n  \n  ABC Q&amp;A host Hamish Macdonald gets a shout out at the beginning of Wang Xining\u2019s speech \u2013 for encouraging him to appear on Australian TV more, following an appearance on Q&amp;A: \n   \n   He encouraged me to be on the TV again to share more Chinese views and perspectives. I am more at ease today, because Hamish is not the host. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.45am BST \n \n \n  3.31am BST  \n  \n  This press club address may be the closest Australian ministers have been to hearing from the CCP since none of them seem to be able to get their counterpart ministers on the phone.  \n  \n \n \n  3.30am BST  \n  \n  The national press club address with the deputy head of mission at the Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Australia is about to begin. \n  As you can see, diplomacy is very, very subtle. \n   \n   \n    National Press Club #represent \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb with a menu of beaut Aussie \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa produce- beef, barley and red wine #agriculture \ud83e\udd69\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf3e https://t.co/hZeZPEoz42\u2014 Senator The Hon.

That was closed last night and all those returning passengers that were in the Travelodge had been moved to another hotel. That was after a couple of days where we received complaints in terms of a number of issues and we acted on those complaints. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.15am BST \n \n \n  2.52am BST  \n NSW police requested private security guards for NSW hotel quarantine \n  \n  The New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, has said police themselves requested private security guards should be used as \u201csecond-tier\u201d security in hotel quarantine. \n  Fuller defended the practice on Wednesday, after nearly 400 people were moved from the Travelodge Wentworth hotel on Tuesday night after police determined the hotel failed to meet the quarantine program\u2019s standards. \n  Two security guards at the Sydney Harbour Marriott have so far tested positive for Covid-19, with genomic testing showing it was initially contracted from a returned traveller from the US. \n  Fuller said he still had confidence in the hotel quarantine system and would \u201caudit and find security guards who aren\u2019t up to scratch\u201d. \n   \n   83,000 shifts of security guards and two positive tests.  \n   [But] I get the significance of this, as I know other states, territories and countries have been let down by quarantine. If I felt the security guard aspect was failing, I would put police in there.  \n   \n  Fuller also told reporters that \u201cEvery hotel has had a complaint at some stage\u201d, and the volume of complaints rose last week. \n   \n   Certainly last week the volume of complaints was unusual, there was an escalation to a point that the commander made a determination [to move travellers from the Travelodge]. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.16am BST \n \n \n  2.51am BST  \n  \n  Many of those comments were from answers to dixers \u2013 questions written by the government, with prepared answers. \n  So those answers, in most of those cases, were prepared.  \n  \n Updated at 3.16am BST \n \n \n  2.48am BST  \n  \n  And a bit more: \n  Peter Dutton: \n   \n   Obviously, the Home Affairs portfolio and the department play a very key part in facilitating trade into and out of Australia and in supporting the states and territories through the pandemic, particularly at the moment with what has happened in Victoria, with the problems around hotel quarantining and the failings or otherwise in Victoria. We have been able to step up with the [national coordination mechanism].  \n   \n  Scott Morrison (again): \n   \n   It is true that part of that national strategy employed by all states and territories have failed in Victoria. That is true.  \n   The testing, tracing and quarantine arrangements have proven to be unacceptable and have led to what we have seen with community outbreak in Victoria.  \n   And that has resulted in the heaviest restrictions we have ever seen. We want to see those restrictions come off and we\u2019re doing everything we can to help Victoria right the situation and stabilise the situation so it can be opened up again. \n   \n  Scott Morrison (and again): \n   \n   Over these many months the minister for aged care has been responsible for the outcomes that I referred to earlier, which have seen Australia be in a position where 97 per cent of facilities in this country, despite the significant community outbreak in Victoria, which the Leader of the Opposition has a blind spot on\u2014the Leader of the Opposition believes that in Victoria there\u2019s nothing going on when it comes to community transmission, that there has been no failure of quarantine, that there has been no failure of tracing.  \n   The Leader of the Opposition seems to think that everything is okay in Victoria, and that there have only been challenges in aged care. The Leader of the Opposition has a blind spot on Victoria.  \n   What we are doing is addressing the challenges that have resulted from the outbreak in community transmission in Victoria \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.44am BST  \n  \n  It continued: \n  Scott Morrison: \n   \n    This has been a terrible outbreak of the virus in Victoria. We cannot ignore that fact in this place. We cannot pretend that these events would have occurred without the community outbreak that occurred in Melbourne and in Victoria.  \n   That is why, as the minister of health was saying earlier, the way to avoid all of this ultimately is to ensure that we make the outbreak containment measures, the protection around quarantine and the testing and tracing, all of which have been brought into question here.  \n   That has led to the community outbreak in Victoria, and that ultimately ends with terrible [aged care] circumstances like those you\u2019ve described. \n   \n  Greg Hunt: \n   \n   Globally now, this pandemic has reached over 23\u00bd million people. Sadly, over 811,000 lives have been lost.  \n   In Australia now, 25,053 cases have been formally diagnosed and 525 lives have been lost.  \n   Today there were 151 new cases, one in hotel quarantine.  \n   There were six states and territories with zero; one state, New South Wales, with two cases in the community; and one state with 148. That\u2019s Victoria. That reflects the trend that we have seen since 1 June. On 1 June, there were 7,370 cases in Victoria.  \n   That has grown to over 25,000 cases now, or an increase of 17,683 cases. I say that because 16,811, or 95 per cent of the increase in Australian cases since 1 June, have come from one state, overwhelmingly from one city, and overwhelmingly from one part of one city.  \n   Ninety-nine per cent of lives lost since 1 June have been lost in Victoria.  \n   So this is very much, sadly and tragically, the issue of one city in one state above all else.  \n   ...We have seen a 1,000% growth in cases in one state. No other state has had more than 25% growth over the course of the last three months.  \n   But what we have done as a country \u2013 when we look around the world at those figures \u2013 is we have seen a containment strategy based on borders, with 94,000 people that have been through the hotel quarantine program and 2,269 positive cases that have been detected and prevented, through that hotel quarantine program, from escaping into the community.  \n   In seven out of eight states and territories, it has worked remarkably well. We know the tragic consequences in one. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.47am BST \n \n \n  2.40am BST  \n  \n  Just as a reminder, here is some of the comments from question time yesterday. \n  Michael McCormack: \n   \n   When there are issues in Melbourne, local communities around Mildura or Bairnsdale shouldn\u2019t have to cop the consequences. Swan Hill is not Swanston Street. When there is a spike in Brisbane, is it fair for businesses in Blackwater or Biloela to face restrictions to their trade? I would argue that it is not.  \n   Imposing stage 4 lockdown in a hotspot such as Melbourne is imperative to the containment of the virus.  \n   No one disputes that; we all know that.  \n   However, imposing stage 3 restrictions on a blanket basis is, I would argue, unjustifiable. I think we can all agree that you do not fix a health issue in Melbourne by creating an economic downturn in Mildura. Due to stage 4 restrictions in Melbourne, where daily Covid-19 cases reached as high as 730 \u2013 and that is very, very sad, and we acknowledge that \u2013 all of regional Victoria was placed on stage 3 restrictions. These non-targeted restrictions are crippling country communities and regional small businesses, particularly in hospitality and tourism.  \n   Many rural communities have not had a Covid case in months \u2013 many not at all \u2013 yet every business in regional Victoria is hurting because of the cluster based outbreaks of the virus. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t stack up. One city, one state, but affecting all of the nation, particularly hurting regional Victoria and regional Australia in general. \n   \n  Josh Frydenberg: \n   \n   More than 6\u00bd million Victorians are doing it very tough.  \n   \u2018There are Victorians right now who are subject to curfews. There are Victorians who have seen businesses close. There are Victorians who have seen schools close. People can\u2019t go to work in Victoria. In Victoria, parents and grandparents are finding it very tough, and kids are not seeing their friends.  \n   This is the heavy price being paid by Victorians for the second wave of Covid-19.  \n   And there\u2019s a huge economic cost as well. It\u2019s treasury\u2019s forecast that up to 400,000 Victorians will either lose their jobs or see their hours reduced to zero. That\u2019s the equivalent of four MCGs full of people on grand final day.  \n   That is 400,000 Victorians who are effectively unemployed as a result of this second wave.  \n   ... Victorians look at New South Wales and ask, \u2018Why not us?\u2019 They look at New South Wales with a lower number of cases and a lower number of deaths and they look at the fact that in New South Wales there have been 315,000 jobs created in recent months. I understand why Victorians are now very concerned by the Victorian government announcing yesterday that it wants to extend the emergency powers for another 12 months. I share those concerns.  \n   The Victorian government has to explain its decision. The Victorian government and the Australian government, under Scott Morrison, will work together to support Victorians. At the end of the day, we will do everything to support Victorians to get to the other side of this crisis, but the Victorian government has a lot of questions to answer. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.42am BST \n \n \n  2.37am BST  \n Morrison denies taking pot shots at Victoria's Covid response \n  \n  Scott Morrison is also claiming that he, and his ministers, did not take pot shots at the Victorian government response yesterday, during question time. \n  Q: Prime Minister, yesterday you pointed to failures in Victoria on contact tracing, testing and quarantine, who is accountable for those failures? Is it the premier?  \n  Morrison:  \n   \n   Well, all I was basically yesterday was the leader of the opposition seemed to have a blind spot on what had occurred in Victoria. And I mean, I don\u2019t think those issues are in great dispute. There has been significant failures there in the areas that you\u2019ve highlighted. And that has of course contributed significantly, overwhelmingly, almost entirely I\u2019d have to say to the community outbreak that we\u2019ve seen. I said earlier this week in the House, that this virus probes for weaknesses. And where those weaknesses are found then it results in what we\u2019ve seen in Victoria. Now, I have no doubt that the Victorian government feels as strongly about this as I do, in terms of the impact it has had on the people of Victoria. They are now subject to these most horrendous restrictions that are regrettably necessary, as I said at the time. But where- we can\u2019t ignore what has occurred in Victoria of course it\u2019s happened. I\u2019m not seeking to get into any blame game here at all. I mean, I work constructively with the Victorian Premier, but where there are issues that need to be raised then I\u2019ll of course raise them with him and I\u2019ve done so consistently and that\u2019s done in the spirit of the partnership that is necessary to work through a crisis. You don\u2019t agree on everything, but you certainly discuss everything. \n   \n   Q: But won\u2019t there be consequences prime minister where both you and the treasurer take shots at the Victorian government and its premier on the floor of the parliament. The cohesion of national cabinet comes to the fore, doesn\u2019t it? Under that pressure? \n  Morrison:  \n   \n   No I think that analysis is exaggerated. I mean all I simply did yesterday was draw attention to some basic facts that I think are well understood. I think for all Australians and particularly all Victorians, I wasn\u2019t seeking to direct any blame anywhere. I was just basically calling out what was the simple facts. I mean, we can\u2019t ignore the fact of what\u2019s happened in Victoria, and I don\u2019t believe the Victorian premier is ignoring it either. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working together to deal with the consequences of what has occurred in Victoria. I do find it strange, though, that Anthony Albanese has a complete blind spot. He must be the only person who doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened in Victoria. I can assure you, Victorians do. I\u2019m not a Victorian and I can work that out. And he\u2019s not one either but he needs to do a bit more work to understand what\u2019s been going on down there, because he doesn\u2019t seem to know and I feel terribly for what Victorians are going through.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.53am BST \n \n \n  2.32am BST  \n  \n  The joint standing committee on electoral matters has released its report on the miscellaneous measures bill - which prompted fury among the Senate crossbench and from Queensland Labor over concerns it will water down state donation laws. \n  JSCEM is controlled by the Coalition, with Liberal James McGrathin the chair, so it\u2019s unsurprising the majority report calls for the bill to be passed.  \n  The Greens have dissented, warning that money can easily flow between state and federal purposes within a party branch, practically defeating state donation bans on developers. They called for separate bank accounts for federal and state purposes and to repeal the bill\u2019s sections that would provide immunity from penalties for prohibited donors who give to a state branch for a federal purpose. \n  Labor\u2019s report is very nuanced - it is presented as a \u201cdissenting report\u201d but recommends the bill be passed if a few amendments are made: \n   \n   Postponing the commencement until after the Queensland election; and \n   Requiring parties to maintain separate bank accounts. \n   \n  The Labor members said: \n   \n   Labor recognises the concerns raised by many submissions to this Inquiry in relation to the proposed amendments to sections 302CA and 314B [the immunity provisions]. However, the commonwealth parliament should be able to make laws with respect to commonwealth elections \u2013 without the threat of those laws being overridden by the states.\u201d \n   \n  So federal Labor accepts that only commonwealth law should apply to donations for federal purposes, but Queensland Labor disagrees and thinks the state laws banning developer donations in the state for all purposes should apply. \n  I think that means the bill is very likely to pass \u2013 but I\u2019ll contact the government to see what they think of Labor amendments. \n  \n Updated at 2.33am BST \n \n \n  2.32am BST  \n Victoria has issued nearly 20,000 fines for coronavirus breaches \n  \n  Victoria police has dished out nearly 20,000 fines for Covid-19 breaches during the pandemic, an inquiry has been told.  \n  Lisa Neville, the police minister, told the Covid-19 inquiry on Wednesday police had issued 19,324 fines, including 1,669 for failing to wear a mask and 2,145 to those breaching the state curfew.There were 5,761 fines for \u201cnon-compliance of directions\u201d and 20 fines were issued for people failing to self-isolate.  \n  \n Updated at 2.34am BST \n \n \n  2.30am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews is asked about these comments from Scott Morrison: \n   \n   I know that the announcement that was made by the premier the other day about that extension of the additional 12 months, I\u2019ve raised our concerns with the premier about that.  \n   I did that directly. I know others have, I know other Labor figures have. And I think it\u2019s important to dispel any uncertainty and get clarity around that issue. I think people are concerned that lockdowns would extend for another 12 months.  \n   Now, we\u2019ve received many calls through offices right across Victoria, including in my office as well.  \n   There was great concern that that would occur. Now, of course, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the premier was suggesting at all. But in these times, we\u2019ve got to be very careful about the announcements that are made. And I welcome the fact that he was clarifying that yesterday.  \n   \n   Andrews: \n   \n   We talk often, send messages often. As he said, we don\u2019t necessarily agree on every matter. We\u2019re working closely together. He doesn\u2019t have to deal with these sorts of issues. There are a whole lot of things that are on his plate I don\u2019t have to deal with. Public health is here [Victoria\u2019s responsibility].  \n   I\u2019m confident with the dialogue we have with the crossbench we can make amendments to the Act next week.  \n   That will mean we can keep people safe. This is the key point. Open up. That\u2019s what the amendments are about. The amendments are about a framework and certainty in the weeks and months ahead to open Victoria up again and to create jobs and prosperity and repair the damage that this pandemic has done to all of us. That\u2019s what these amendments are all about. I\u2019m confident that we will get a good outcome that serves both of those purposes. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.32am BST \n \n \n  2.23am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews is asked whether or not he would have supported legislation like this when he was opposition leader (which was six years ago). \n   \n   We are not in six years ago. This is a 1 in 100 year event. Six years ago seems a long time ago. Six days ago seems a long time ago. These are unprecedented times. We understand \u2013 we fully understand \u2013 we have had to make decisions that have been very painful, that have caused great harm.  \n   But at the same time, to let this thing run wild \u2013 I want to make a point I have not made for quite some time because it wasn\u2019t relevant.  \n   There are some in the community who don\u2019t think this is real.  \n   There are some who think, \u201cLet it rip. I\u2019m fit. Young and healthy.\u201d  \n   The problem with your hospital system being overrun is it isn\u2019t just overrun and struggling to provide care and support to Covid-19 patients, every stroke, motor vehicle accident, heart attack, every cancer surgery, every thing we need that is time-critical gets overrun.  \n   We need to remember \u2013 we need to remember \u2013 that whilst we have had to make many decisions that are a very painful, the alternative we see in other parts of the world how tragic it is.  \n   That isn\u2019t in any way \u2013 any way to take attention away from the great hardship in the Victorian community.  \n   We will do the work to repair that damage. We will all work very hard to do that. But the alternative is not something that any of us could ever settle for. It isn\u2019t hundreds of death, it is many, many of thousands.  \n   It isn\u2019t just Covid-19. It debilitates and undermines your healthcare system for everyone who needs it. On any given day, there are hundreds of people who need that sort of care. Care they wouldn\u2019t be able to get if we were to listen to some of the conspiracy theories, and if we were to listen to some people who are out there almost inviting people to not follow rules. That\u2019s in no one\u2019s interests. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.35am BST \n \n \n  2.20am BST  \n  \n  Who wants the legislation to extend the state of emergency declaration in Victoria? \n  Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   The proposed are supported by the public health team, supported by experts, and when you think about it, that isn\u2019t a surprising thing.  \n   This is not the notion that there will be rules in 12 months. It\u2019s simply the ability to make rules.  \n   The legal authority to make rules, based on advice, based on a proportional response to whatever the challenge is.  \n   We can\u2019t have a situation where we go from stage 4 to stage 1 or stage 0, you know, basically we all want it to be over so let\u2019s just pretend that it is. We can\u2019t do that.  \n   The other thing too, I just say if you want to try \u2013 perhaps this is the best way to make the point.  \n   If you want to say to business, \u2018Here\u2019s a six-month or a 12-month plan to rebuild, to open up, to recover, to repair the damage that\u2019s been done by this global pandemic, then I need to have some certainty that the plan that I am putting forward has got the legal authority that it needs.  \n   Therefore, some sort of week by week thing or month by month doesn\u2019t really work. Again, I want to stress, though, no rules will be if place for a moment longer than they need to be.  \n   And this is about opening up, about less rules. This is about finding Covid normal. Not stage 4 continuing for a moment longer than it needs to. I know it is frustrating we can\u2019t provide people with absolutely definitive dates.  \n   But that is the nature of this thing. That is the nature of the wildly infectious, wicked enemy we are up against. Without that legal certainty, it \u2013 in a practical way, it gets hard to plan. What does stage 3 look like? Following that, what does stage 2 look like? How do we get back to something very close to normal, but will have to be that Covid normal. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.23am BST \n \n \n  2.18am BST  \n  \n  Back to Victoria \u2013 is there an idea of what stage three restrictions will look like for Melbourne yet? \n  Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   It is a bit early for us to provide a definitive road map or pathway in relation to what stages 3 and 2 will look like.  \n   As soon as we can do that, I want to make it clear to every worker, to every business, to every investor across the state.  \n   These rules won\u2019t be in place a moment longer than they need to be.  \n   We will at the appropriate time, as soon as we can, try and map out as best we can a plan for very significant effort on the part of the government to underpin the considerable efforts of the private sector are making and will certainly make on the other side of this, to make sure we have jobs and skills and we have the strength back into the Victorian economy that we are well-known for, and that is so important, not just for us, but for the entire nation.  \n   I wish I could provide you with a series of absolutely definitive dates and trigger points, if you like. We can\u2019t \u2013 that isn\u2019t the nature of this thing. That is one of the most frustrating elements of the fight. We have to keep these numbers coming down, which means we have to keep doing all the things we have been doing following those rules, as challenging as that is. Not letting our fatigue get the better of us and then there will be a time for us to outline a comprehensive plan for investment, for job, for skills, and to make sure that Victoria can be strong again and play a massive part in the economic success of our nation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.24am BST \n \n \n  2.14am BST  \n Five new Covid cases in NSW have an unknown source of transmission \n  \n  NSW has reported six new cases today \u2013 one in hotel quarantine and five are locally acquired. \n  All five have an unknown source of transmission.  \n  Alerts have also been issued for some sites in the Sydney CBD \u2013 including the City Tattersalls Fitness Centre on Pitt Street, where two people attended. Anyone there on August 19, 21 or 23 should get tested if any symptoms develop. \n  Alerts have also been issued for 300 George Street Sydney, on August 19, 20, 21, 24 and the Apple Store and Kmart in Broadway shopping centre on August 22 between 3:30 and 5pm. \n  One person who contracted Covid-19 is a trainee bus driver who worked for one day while infectious, and had \u201ca limited number of a passengers\u201d. The chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said the risk to passengers was \u201cvery low\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 2.20am BST \n \n \n  2.14am BST  \n  \n  Cameron Wilson, a reporter with Gizmodo, is one of the reporters who have been keeping an eye on which MPs have been following those \u2018social media\u2019 trend treatments. \n  You will not be surprised to find the names \u2018Craig Kelly\u2019 and \u2018George Christensen\u2019 pop up there.  \n  \n Updated at 2.21am BST \n \n \n  2.12am BST  \n  \n  Professor Julian Elliott said Australia has benefitted from not rushing in with unproven treatments: \n   \n   I think that there\u2019s been a lot of controversy about different elements of treatment in care.  \n   Again, you know, one of the things I think we can be proud of here in Australia and Victoria is that we haven\u2019t jumped on to the latest bandwagon because of a particular trend on social media.  \n   We have taken a very considered approach to that. And so in the end, what that meant is that Victorians and Australians have not been exposed to the potential harms or side effects of treatments that are not got a robust evidence base or not proven.  \n   I think in the any response in any pandemic response, of course, there is always things you can think about that we could do better. But I think just to note that \u2013 you know, the care that is being provided for people with Covid-19 in Australia, I think, is absolutely world-class. \n   .. .I think one of the things to keep in mind is that we do have effective treatments for Covid-19.  \n   \n   \n   I think people would be aware of a lot of controversy around hydroxychloroquine and we make a recommendation that hydroxychloroquine should not be used.  \n   Certainly outside of a research setting. Because there\u2019s now substantial information that it\u2019s not effective, and it does have side effects.  \n   I think that has been a message that many people have heard and are aware of. But they may be less aware that we actually do have some effective treatments.  \n   So, for example, dexamethasone, a widely available, very cheap anti-inflammatory \u2013 a drug that reduces your \u2013 the inflammation in the body - has been shown in people with more severe disease to reduce mortality by up to a third.  \n   That\u2019s an extraordinary benefit for a drug that we know very well, we have used for many years, it is very widely available and cheap. I hope people are aware.  \n   We have an antiviral called remdesivir, which is again given for people with more severe disease who are in hospital. That has been shown to quicken the time to recovery. It doesn\u2019t reduce mortality, but it enables people to recover more quickly. We know that there is more research coming every week.  \n   We expect more data next week that will be incorporate into our guidelines. Of course, all the subsequent weeks following that. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.22am BST \n \n \n  2.08am BST  \n  \n  Professor Wai-Hong Tham: \n   \n   What the antibody treatment is designed to do is to actually have antibodies that target the spike protein.  \n   Because the spike protein is what the virus uses to enter cells. And so what the virus does is has a lock and key mechanism between spike protein and human cells. So, if you can actually bind an antibody that blocks spike from doing the interaction with the human cells, you stop virus infection.  \n   And so what we are trying to do is to unmask that scientific evidence that we know very well about the virus now and to actually develop two potent combinations of antibodies that gum up the function of spike, stop it from entering cells in laboratory settings, which we have identified, and by combining two different types of antibodies you can also stop the escape of mutations.  \n   What you\u2019re developing really are antibodies you can deliver to patients, that you know are already going to be safe, that are going to be potent, they\u2019re going to stop virus entry, stop virus infection, and they probably hopefully will work against all the variants that you have in the community. \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.07am BST  \n  \n  Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Associate Professor Wai-Hong Tham and Monash University Associate Professor Julian Elliott are guests at the Daniel Andrews press conference, speaking about breakthroughs in treatments for Covid. \n  \n \n \n  2.05am BST  \n NSW records six new cases of Covid \n  \n  NSW has diagnosed six new cases of Covid in the last 24 \u2013 just one of those is in hotel quarantine.  \n  \n Updated at 2.07am BST \n \n \n  1.56am BST  \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s workplace watchdog is investigating a lack of PPE and training provided to private security guards in the state\u2019s bungled hotel quarantine program.  \n  Colin Radford, chief executive of Worksafe, confirmed the probes while fronting the state\u2019s Covid-19 inquiry on Wednesday,  \n  Eight sites were under investigation, the inquiry heard.  \n  Radford also confirmed Victoria\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions were the subject of Worksafe probes for Covid-19 breaches.  \n  An investigation into an outbreak at the Cedar Meats site was \u201congoing\u201d, Radford said.  \n  \n Updated at 1.59am BST \n \n \n  1.56am BST  \n  \n  Before going to questions, Daniel Andrews again talks about the legislation he is trying to get passed, which would allow Victoria to extend its state of emergency declaration beyond six months. \n  I\u2019m not an expert, but a quick whip around of the powers of the other states seems to point to them not actually having a time limit to their state of emergency. They can renew the declaration \u2013 and its powers \u2013 as often as they want (NSW can just change health regulations and get the same powers). \n  But Victoria has a maximum of six months. Which will be hit on 13 September. \n  The legislation will allow the declaration to be extended beyond that date. If successful, the government would still have to regularly renew the declaration, but they\u2019ll be able to do that for a year, rather than six months. \n  Andrews says conversations with the crossbench are proving fruitful: \n   \n   I can report to you that we\u2019re having very, very productive discussions with the crossbench and I\u2019m very hopeful that we will get \u2013 we will get an outcome that allows the chief health officer to continue to do his important work, allows all of the team to continue to make decisions based on science and evidence that are proportionate to the challenges we face.  \n   That will underpin us opening up. I think we have just got to think for a moment \u2013 imagine the plight of the business that were to open up in just a few weeks\u2019 time, and then we don\u2019t have the power to keep people who have got this virus at home. So that becomes a kind of an honesty policy.  \n   Even a handful of those people, perhaps make the wrong choice, and this gets away from us again. Imagine the impact on that business.  \n   Imagine the impact on staff. Imagine the impact across the board. There are some basics here.  \n   And the ability with legal authority to make sure that someone who is positive with this virus stays at home and stays safe away from other people, you simply can\u2019t have an opening-up strategy unless you have the ability to make those sorts of rules. Not the stage 4 hard lockdown rules.  \n   We\u2019re working as hard as we can to get past those, to get well and truly beyond those, but the key to opening up is not going from stage 4 to stage 0, where there are no rules.  \n   There has to be a framework. And it does cover simple things like risking industries, dangerous industries from a Covid-19 point of view, having compulsory safety plans.  \n   Things like people who are positive having to stay at home for that 14-day period. We\u2019re having very productive discussions, as we always do, with the crossbench.  \n   We\u2019re very confident that we will be able to get an outcome that both protects public health but just as importantly allows us to plan for the future with some certainty. Not for a week or a month, but for many months.  \n   The ability to plan and open up a proper plan of jobs and recovery, that\u2019s only possible if you have got the certainty of being able to put rules in place \u2013 common sense rules \u2013 rules that are proportionate, not just for a very short period of time but for a longer period of time.  \n   That\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at here. That is what we want to try and achieve.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.01am BST \n \n \n  1.47am BST  \n Disability care in Victoria has 50 active Covid cases and aged care has 1,487 \n  \n  There are 50 active cases in disability care in Victoria. \n  On aged care, Daniel Andrews says: \n   \n   In terms of aged care, the total outbreaks that are active is 1,487.  \n   And in terms of outbreaks, our total active outbreaks in aged care is 121.  \n   The combined efforts of our government, the commonwealth government and all agencies, both in aged care, but also in these very complex disability facility settings, is working well. \n   It is very challenging. But we have seen some significant stability come to those environments.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.50am BST \n \n \n  1.43am BST  \n Andrews urges more Victorians to come forward for Covid testing after testing numbers drop \n  \n  Testing is still down in Victoria. \n  It could be a problem. \n  Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   It does make some sense that as you have less symptoms in the community, you have less people who are symptomatic coming forward and getting tested. Lockdown, I think, also makes it perhaps somewhat harder for people to go and get tested. I\u2019ll make a couple of points.  \n   Firstly, having as many people as possible \u2013 that is to say, everyone who\u2019s got symptom, even the mildest symptom, come forward and get tested is critically important in our strategy.  \n   It is critically important not only to driving case numbers down, but it\u2019s critically important to us opening up and making sure that businesses can survive, making sure that people can have their job back, that people \u2013 there can be new job opportunities across the Victorian economy.  \n   All of that activity is predicated on us having \u2013 without putting a number on it \u2013 because the number also move around, but all of that activity, all of those rule changes are predicated on us having what the experts believe is a credible and accurate picture of how much virus is out there in the Victorian community.  \n   So, I just say, again, to every single Victorian regardless of your circumstance, regardless of your setting, your postcode, if you have got symptoms, even the mildest of symptoms, as soon as those symptoms start, as soon as there\u2019s an onset of those symptoms, please come forward and get tested.  \n   It\u2019s a massive \u2013 a powerful thing that you can do to support everyone across the community in our strategy and our fight against this wildly infectious virus. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.55am BST \n \n \n  1.42am BST  \n Daniel Andrews press conference \n  \n  Daniel Andrews: \n   \n   I\u2019m saddened to have to inform you that there are now 462 Victorians who have lost their life due to this global pandemic.  \n   That is an increase of 24 since yesterday\u2019s report. Of course, our thoughts and best wishes, our sympathies and deepest condolences are with the families of each of those 24 Victorians.  \n   They are comprised of one female in their 60s, three males in their 70s, three males and seven males in their 80, six females and four males in their 90s, 21 of those 24 fatalities are linked to aged care outbreaks and, again, we send our deepest sympathies and condolences to each of those families.  \n   There are 578 Victorians in hospital. 39 of those are receiving intensive care and 16 of those 39 are on a ventilator.  \n   The total of 2,132,679 test results have been received since the beginning of the pandemic.  \n   That is 13,480 since yesterday. I will come back to testing in just a moment.  \n   There are 4,116 cases with an unknown origin, 55 that have been closed out and added to that total since yesterday. 434 health workers who are active cases.  \n   Those numbers have stabilised and are coming down. That is pleasing. We don\u2019t want to see any of our dedicated health workers \u2013 regardless of setting or the discipline they work in \u2013 contract the virus. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.44am BST \n \n \n  1.33am BST  \n  \n  Wang Xining, the deputy head of mission with the Chinese embassy in Canberra, is speaking to the national press club today. \n  That will be ... interesting.  \n  \n Updated at 1.35am BST \n \n \n  1.29am BST  \n  \n  Victorians have been more likely to challenge fines during the coronavirus pandemic, the state\u2019s attorney general says.  \n  Jill Hennessy told the Covid-19 committee on Wednesday fine recipients had been increasingly seeking review of fines, as well as more people indicating they intend to challenge the fine in court.  \n  The attorney general did not provide comparative figures, but the inquiry was told there had been 1,108 Covid-19 fines were being disputed.

But the newly proposed fee of $7,950 is still higher than the $6,804 that would apply if the legislation failed to pass the Senate. \n   In order to offset what it says are \u201cfee reductions for psychology and social work\u201d, the government has revealed it will increase the maximum fee for some other disciplines by $250 compared with the original package outlined a few months ago. \n   The affected disciplines \u2013 which are at the lower end of the fee range \u2013 include teaching, English, maths, nursing, agriculture, allied health, engineering and several other disciplines. \n   \n   \n    Related: University fee rises: Nationals' deal for psychology and social work to cost other students  \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.54am BST  \n Victorians in custody contracting coronavirus, inquiry told \n  \n  There have been 19 young people in custody within Victoria\u2019s youth justice system who have contracted coronavirus during the pandemic, an inquiry has been told.  \n  Victoria\u2019s Covid-19 parliamentary inquiry also heard 23 Victorian prisoners and six staff have tested positive over the course of the crisis.  \n  Five young people who are supervised by youth justice staff in the community have also caught the virus, as have four youth justice staff. \n  Most of the staff who tested positive were not working while they were infectious, the inquiry heard.  \n  \n Updated at 1.05am BST \n \n \n  12.54am BST  \n  \n  Queensland police have also launched a criminal investigation into those on board the Lady Pamela luxury yacht which travelled from Melbourne to the Gold Coast.  \n  \n Updated at 1.05am BST \n \n \n  12.51am BST  \n  \n  Queensland has had 64 flights come in in the last 24 hours, with 2,904 travellers.  \n  Two people were refused entry. \n  3,412 vehicles were stopped at the borders and 107 people were turned back and 455 people were sent into quarantine. \n  The 94 children who were released from the Wacol youth detention centre, before the infection was diagnosed, have been cooperative with police and there are \u201cno particular concerns\u201d. \n  22 people have received notices to appear in court for breaching quarantine, and 78 on-the-spot fines have been issued in relation to the border. So that is now 2,254 on-the-spot fines.  \n  And someone with a border pass, which only allows them to stay in the border region, was found in north Queensland. They were stopped for a random breath test, found out, placed in quarantine, and fined. \n  \n Updated at 1.06am BST \n \n \n  12.44am BST  \n  \n  Queensland chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young says so far there has been no community transmission as a result of the first five cases which sparked the new cluster. \n  Authorities still don\u2019t know how the original person diagnosed with the virus contracted the infection.  \n  \n Updated at 1.07am BST \n \n \n  12.43am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Andrews will hold his press conference at 10.30am this morning. \n  \n Updated at 12.44am BST \n \n \n  12.43am BST  \n  \n  Queensland recorded more than 20,000 Covid tests in the last 24 hours, which makes just one positive result even better news.  \n  \n \n \n  12.42am BST  \n  \n  Annastacia Palaszczuk has also acknowledged the federal court decision on the borders yesterday: \n   \n   I just want to briefly mention the federal court decision that came down. I\u2019m quite sure that the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, will have more to say about that today.  \n   But Queensland also joined with Western Australia in that case. And what that means is that the border measures are there in place to keep the health of their residents safe. So that\u2019s what the federal court has found.  \n   I\u2019m very pleased with that result because that is exactly what I have been saying. That is exactly what Queenslanders have been saying to me as well \u2013 that they want us to keep them safe.  \n   So what that means \u2013 if we can minimise the virus coming into Queensland, it means it\u2019s keeping the health of our families safe, but also, too, it also means that we are actually allowing the economy to open up here. And that is good for businesses and that\u2019s good for people who are working right across Queensland. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.44am BST \n \n \n  12.39am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison has very helpfully intervened in Daniel Andrews\u2019s fight to have the state of emergency declaration extended beyond six months: \n   \n   I feel terribly for what are going through and I know that announcement by the premier about the extension of addition 12 months, I raised our concerns with the premier about that, I did that directly. \n   I think it\u2019s important to dispel any uncertainty and get clarity around that issue, people were concerned the lockdowns would extend for another 12 months, there was great concern that would occur. \n   Now of course that wasn\u2019t what the premier was suggesting at all but in these times we need to be very careful about the announcements that are made and I welcome the fact that he\u2019s clarified that yesterday. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.42am BST \n \n \n  12.37am BST  \n Queensland records one new case of coronavirus \n  \n  Queensland has had one new case of Covid diagnosed in the last 24 hours \u2013 a close contact of a known case, who has been in isolation. \n  \n Updated at 12.42am BST \n \n \n  12.29am BST  \n  \n  The bells are ringing for the parliament sitting. \n  Sigh \n  \n \n \n  12.21am BST  \n Tasmanians are now eligible for $1,500 paid pandemic leave \n  \n  Also announced this morning \u2013 Tasmanians are now eligible for paid pandemic leave: \n   \n   Tasmanian workers are now eligible for a $1,500 pandemic leave disaster payment if they cannot work because they need to self-isolate or quarantine. \n   The Australian government has extended pandemic leave disaster payment arrangements to include Tasmania following agreement with the Tasmanian government. \n   It is a lump sum payment to help workers during their 14-day self-isolation period and applies from 22 August 2020. \n   If an individual is instructed by a health official to stay home from work, and has used up all their sick leave entitlements, including any special pandemic leave, they may be eligible to make a claim. People may also be eligible if they\u2019re the parent or guardian of a child aged 16 or under who is a close contact or has tested positive for Covid-19. \n   Tasmanians workers are eligible for the payment if they are not receiving income, earnings or salary maintenance from work, receiving the jobkeeper payment or other forms of Australian government income support. The payment can be claimed again should an extended quarantine period longer than 14 days be instructed by health officials. \n   To date in Victoria more than $8.8m has been paid for almost 6,000 granted claims since 6 August. \n    The fastest and easiest way to make a claim is over the phone by calling 180 22 66.  \n   Please do not visit a service centre.

Also state governments too. Isn\u2019t it a shared blame? \n  Albanese:  \n   \n   What we had was the Prime Minister stand in his courtyard way back in February and he waved around document saying, \u2018This is how we will deal with this\u2019. It explicitly said of course that aged care was the responsibility of the Federal Government because it is on a day-to-day basis. The states run the hospital system, the Federal Government runs aged care. They regulate it, they fund it. They set up the accreditation agency. It is all a Federal responsibility. \n   \n  Q: The prime minister is also saying 97% of aged care facilities have had no infections at all. Is that a fair point? \n  Albanese:  \n   \n   It is a heartless comment, frankly. And I was shocked when he said that. I think it does not pay appropriate respect to the fact that we have 335 people who were in aged care residence who have passed. And their families are grieving. We have circumstances whereby, I know, I will never forget saying goodbye to my mum. It was many years ago. She only lived to 65. But I got to say goodbye to her. These people are saying goodbye to their loved ones on FaceTime. And they deserve better than just the prime minister saying that 97% is OK. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.19am BST \n \n \n  12.04am BST  \n  \n  Another vaccine announcement - this time, committing to help Australia\u2019s neighbours for when there is a vaccine: \n   \n   Australia will support the Gavi COVAX Facility Advance Market Commitment (COVAX AMC) to improve access for Pacific and Southeast Asian countries to safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines. \n   The COVAX AMC will secure and distribute COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, not just those that can afford to purchase or manufacture vaccines themselves. \n   Australia\u2019s contribution of $80 million will help secure COVID-19 vaccines for Pacific Island and Southeast Asian countries. The AMC will address the acute phase of the pandemic, providing doses for up to 20 percent of countries\u2019 populations in its first phase, ensuring that health care workers and vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, have access. \n   Access to vaccines will play a critical role in the economic recovery of our region from this pandemic. \n   Pacific countries eligible for COVAX AMC support include Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Kiribati. Eligible countries from Southeast Asia are Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, The Philippines and Vietnam. \n   Australia\u2019s investment builds on our strong support for Gavi. Australia will continue to promote health security in our region through our role as the Vice-Chair of the Gavi Board. \n   International investment in vaccine manufacturing and procurement is stronger when nations work together. In making this investment, Australia joins key donors such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy and Norway. \n   The COVAX AMC forms part of the wider COVAX Facility, a global mechanism designed to enable rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines to end the acute phase of the pandemic by 2021. \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.03am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese was on Sydney radio 2SM this morning once again calling for Richard Colbeck to be sacked. \n  He also mentioned this, which goes to some of the wider issues in aged care, even before the pandemic, which are still to be addressed. Even though we know about them. And have, for some time.  \n  Albanese: Last Thursday, Susan Templeman, who\u2019s our fantastic local member servicing the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, invited me Richmond to sit down with families of aged care residents. And the stories I heard were quite shocking. One spoke about how she asked what her mum was being fed, the menu. Now, Monday was sausage rolls for dinner. Tuesday was party pies. Wednesday was a croissant. \n   Q: A croissant for dinner? \n  Albanese:  \n   \n   It had cheese in it, I think. Essentially frozen stuff that you can buy, no brand, at Coles and Woolies. it would have cost $1 each for dinner for people who should be getting sustenance and people who should be in a position whereby, this is a private facility where a woman\u2019s paying substantial fees, and this facility has failed its accreditation.  \n   And when the residents\u2019 families sought to, because the inspection body, believe it or not, they give notice when they\u2019re going to inspect a facility. So, you\u2019ve got a week to clean up your act.  \n   When they asked to see the people in charge, these bureaucrats, when they went through the issues that they had at the facility, they were told, \u2018We are not the complaints unit\u2019.  \n   And these family members said, \u2018Well, who are we supposed to complain to?\u2019 The system is simply not functioning properly.  \n   And what we had is that report last year. And then we had earlier in the year, because the outbreaks, of course, were first in Europe and not in Australia, we could see what was coming, and all of the advice was that older people were particularly vulnerable to this pandemic.  \n   And in spite of that, there was no response put in place. No plan put in place by the federal government, which it has got to be said, they fund and regulate aged care. The federal government are responsible.  \n   Then you had Dorothy Henderson Lodge in March and Newmarch House in April. So, we could see the issues that were there. Again, no plans put in place. And the Royal Commissioners have said that there was no plan in place. And what\u2019s the Federal Government\u2019s response?  \n   They criticise the Royal Commission that they established. The Royal Commissioners that they appointed. This is simply not good enough. Older Australians have built this nation.  \n   They are deserving of respect and to live out their later years with dignity. And the fact is that one of the people said to me last week, that one of the things about a pandemic is it\u2019s like an X-ray, it shows what is broken.  \n   Well, this system is broken. I met with aged care workers at the Health Services Union last Tuesday, and one of the things that they were talking about is the fact that they\u2019ve got to work at two or three facilities which is one of the ways in which this virus has spread. Because they get paid $19 an hour.  \n   There\u2019s casualised employment. There is not a proper workforce plan. We don\u2019t have the right number of nurses, carers and other workers in these facilities. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.07am BST \n \n \n  11.50pm BST  \n  \n  This is quite the way to write $903,000. \n   \n   \n    It\u2019s taken 80 days (!!!) to NOT provide an answer on taxpayer money spent on the PM\u2019s secretive COVID-19 Commission. 2/2#transparency #righttoknow #auspol pic.twitter.com/UINfR8mB2H\u2014 Katy Gallagher (@SenKatyG) August 25, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.08am BST \n \n \n  11.41pm BST  \n  \n  Victoria Health has now released those official figures \n   \n   \n    #COVID19VicData for 26 August, 2020.149 new cases detected in Victoria yesterday.

In aged care facilities, there now 1,100 active cases of coronavirus, and I express my condolences to the family members of those who have died and my support and best wishes to those aged care residents who are currently battling coronavirus. \n    We have to ask - how many of those deaths were preventable? How many cases of coronavirus in residential aged care were preventable? If only Scott Morrison and Richard Colbeck had heeded the warning calls - and there have been so many warning calls.  \n   There were in April, the outbreaks in Newmarch House and Dorothy Henderson Lodge in New South Wales. \n   There\u2019s the call from Scott Morrison\u2019s own backbencher Russell Broadbent.  \n   Russell Broadbent in 2017 resigned from his parliamentary positions because he was so frustrated at the Government\u2019s lack of action at aged care in his electorate.  \n   Russell Broadbent who says this morning that the Government put profits over care. Profits over people; that\u2019s the aged care system that Scott Morrison\u2019s own colleagues describe. Scott Morrison and Richard Colbeck are presiding over an aged care system that puts profits over people.  \n   And we know from Russell Broadbent, today, that he raised these concerns, and he says back in 2017, and ever since, I\u2019ve been raising these concerns, raising these warning bells, and I have been ignored. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.12am BST \n \n \n  11.31pm BST  \n  \n  And given that the Liberals, the National\u2019s senior partners in the Coalition tend to have a whole \u201cfree market\u201d belief going on, how will this work if it means telling supermarkets what they can and can\u2019t do (although we have seen a lot of eroding of that whole free market philosophy when it comes to things like energy companies lately, so you know, the precedents are there.) \n  David Littleproud: \n   \n   Well, this is a core principle of the National party around fairness.  \n   We\u2019re a Coalition partner and we\u2019re proud to make sure we protect our constituency with fairness. As I said, this isn\u2019t about regulating prices, this is simply making sure that there is a framework of fairness in how all parties deal with one another.  \n   There is a grocery code of conduct at the moment, but it very much only focuses on the big companies, not on small family farms. And I think what we\u2019re saying is these small family farms don\u2019t have much power, don\u2019t have any legal recourse because they don\u2019t have the financial means in which to prosecute.  \n   So is there a framework that needs to be put in place? And if you\u2019re doing the right thing, it costs nobody anything and so the supermarkets who proclaim they have done nothing wrong, they should fear nothing. Even if there was regulation, it costs them nothing anyway. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.37pm BST \n \n \n  11.29pm BST  \n  \n  Speaking to the ABC this morning, David Littleproud said this inquiry would be different to the other inquiries: \n   \n   Well, this is where we\u2019re going to make sure it is only three months, it\u2019s on the dairy code of conduct extension, which only went to the processor level, and we\u2019ll look to have this done by Christmas as well as these other agricultural perishable goods.  \n   We heard a lot of anecdotal evidence. ACCC has, in fact, got past evidence around this.  \n   What we\u2019re trying to do is to try to quantify it and validate it. To make sure if there is an imbalance, there needs to be looked at and regulated in terms of a Code of Conduct, then we will act quickly.  \n   We don\u2019t want to kick this into the grass.  \n   Farmers can come forward a confidential manner with the ACCC without recourse or fear of retribution from any of their supply chains. We\u2019re going to do this and sort this out once and for all. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.37pm BST \n \n \n  11.24pm BST  \n  \n  The federal government wants the ACCC to investigate agricultural chains, from farm to the store, to see how farmers are being treated. \n  From David Littleproud and Josh Frydenberg:  \n   \n   The Government will direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to undertake an inquiry into harmful imbalances of bargaining power between farmers, intermediaries, including processors, and retailers in the domestic supply chains of perishable agricultural goods in Australia. \n   The Government is focussed on ensuring the right domestic policy settings are in place, and is directing the ACCC to examine the nature of bargaining power in the supply chains for perishable agricultural goods covering meat (pork, lamb, beef), poultry (chicken meat and eggs), seafood, and horticulture goods where not already covered by a mandatory industry code. \n   This inquiry will examine whether imbalances in bargaining relationships exist and the extent to which they can be addressed through existing regulatory arrangements. The ACCC will be provided the power to seek evidence, documents and information from businesses within the domestic supply chain to assess if there is a harmful imbalance of bargaining power occurring. \n   The ACCC will also examine the effectiveness of the new Dairy Code of Conduct including by considering options to extend the code across the entire domestic dairy supply chain. \n   In conducting its inquiry, the ACCC is to have regard to the interests of Australian consumers and how the impacts of unreasonable bargaining power imbalances in the supply chain can affect them. \n   \n  Goodness. It\u2019s almost like the Queensland election is upon us. And like National electorates in NSW and Victoria have been screaming for someone to look at this for years and there is suddenly a reason to look at it! \n  \n \n \n  11.21pm BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison responded to reports Tony Abbott (maybe) has a new job on the UK\u2019s board of trade and (if so, maybe not, as reported by the Sun, as joint president). \n   \n   A good hire.

That is the last extension of the declaration, which allows police more powers, as well as give public health officials extraordinary powers, including restrictions on movements. The other states can extend their declarations (or in the case of NSW, just change health regulations to grant the powers it wants) but Victoria has a maximum of six months written into its legislation. It wants to extend that maximum time period a state of emergency can be declared to a year. That doesn\u2019t mean lockdown will be extended though. \n  The extension legislation has become the flashpoint in tensions between the federal government and Victoria to explode. In yesterday\u2019s question time, federal ministers, including the prime minister, lined up to criticise Victoria\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \n  That is a marked break from the bipartisan \u2018we are all in this together\u2019 narrative Scott Morrison had publicly been pushing (although it\u2019s not the first time the federal MPs had criticised Andrews, or the first time stories critical of the Victorian response had been briefed out) But keep an eye on that. \n  In NSW, small amounts of community transmission continue to keep authorities on their toes. \n  Late yesterday, NSW Health sent out this alert: \n  NSW Health is investigating two cases of Covid-19 who attended City Tattersalls Fitness Centre on Pitt Street. Anyone who attended this venue on August 19, 21 or 23 should be alert for symptoms, and if any develop get tested and self-isolate immediately. NSW Health is working closely with City Tattersalls Fitness Centre to directly contact close contacts. \n  NSW Health is also alerting people who may have been to 300 George Street Sydney on August 19, 20, 21 or 24 to be alert for symptoms, and if any develop to get tested and self-isolate immediately, after one of the cases worked here while infectious. \n  Queensland is also keeping an eye on community transmission as contact tracers rush to get a lid on a cluster which popped up late last week, after an employee at a youth detention centre tested positive for Covid. Genomic testing is still underway, but the strain of the newest infection is the same as one of the women who went to Melbourne and skipped out on quarantine after allegedly lying on her border declaration pass. That, as the Queensland CMO, Dr Jeannette Young, said yesterday doesn\u2019t mean a link \u2013 that strain is the most common one in Melbourne at the moment \u2013 so more testing is under way. But Queensland thinks it might have missed a case of community transmission, which is why everyone with symptoms is being asked to get a test. \n  We\u2019ll bring you all the day\u2019s politics and Covid news as it happens.

Updated at 11.52pm BST     11.27pm BST       Smoke from deforestation-related fires in the Brazilian Amazon last year hospitalised more than 2,000 people and led to a \u201csignificant negative impact on public health\u201d in the region, researchers have said. With similar serious fires expected this year, on top of a deadly Covid-19 pandemic, heavily hospitalisations are likely to be repeated, \u201cpotentially collapsing\u201d an already overburdened health system in the region, they said in a report. \u201cWe are watching a situation similar, or even worse, than last year,\u201d said Ane Alencar, director of science at IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, one of the institutions behind the study. More than 4,500 square kilometres of Amazon land deforested this year or cleared but not burned last year could be set on fire during this year\u2019s dry season, which normally runs from July to September, according to the new study. In July, the Amazon region saw a 28% increase in fires compared to the same period last year, it said. Miguel Lago, executive director of IEPS, Brazil\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies, called the north of Brazil the largest area of \u201cclinic deserts\u201d - areas of limited healthcare availability - in the country. The Amazonian region around Manaus, for instance, has only 8.8 intensive care hospital beds per 100,000 people, below the Brazilian health ministry\u2019s recommendation of 10 beds, Lago said. The Amazon has seen the worst outbreak of Covid-19 in Brazil, itself one of the countries most heavily impacted by the virus. \u201cWe have a very fragile health system in the Amazon, that has had a hard time facing the pandemic. So the coincidence of fires and the pandemic is very, very bad,\u201d Lago said. More needs to be done to limit forest fires in the region this year, with the healthcare system already struggling to deal with coronavirus cases, he said. \u201cWe should be doing everything we can to avoid hospitalisation - and in this case fires are totally avoidable,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.       10.49pm BST    Gaza coronavirus lockdown extended by 72 hours after infections spread    Gaza will remain in lockdown at least until Sunday, health officials said after reporting two deaths and 26 Covid-19 cases in the first public outbreak of the coronavirus in the blockaded Palestinian enclave. As of two days ago, when the first four cases were discovered in a refugee camp in the 360 square-kilometre territory, and a 48-hour lockdown was imposed, there had been no infections outside border quarantine facilities for new arrivals. But by late on Wednesday, health officials said 26 people in several locations had tested positive for Covid-19 and two patients had died - a sign the world pandemic had penetrated Gaza\u2019s forced isolation. The 40-kilometre-long territory run by Hamas Islamists is sealed off from the outside world by Israeli walls, watchtowers and gunboats along 90% of its border and coastline, and by Egypt along a narrow strip to the south. Both countries impose tight restrictions on movement in and out of Gaza, citing security concerns over Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States. The new infections added to concerns among local and international health organisations about Gaza\u2019s potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital capacity.       10.15pm BST       The UK and US governments are in talks to introduce an \u201cair bridge\u201d between London and New York to enable travellers to sidestep quarantine, The Telegraph has reported. Ministers are studying plans for regional air bridges that would enable business and other travellers to come to Britain from \u201clow-risk\u201d areas such as New York City within countries that are \u201cred listed\u201d because of their continued overall high coronavirus rates, the report said.       10.10pm BST       Brazil reported 47,161 new cases of Covid-19 and 1,086 deaths in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said. Brazil has registered 3,717,156 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 117,666, according to ministry data, in the world\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreak outside the United States       9.32pm BST       Brazil has asked Chinese authorities to provide results of laboratory tests that detected traces of Covid-19 on chicken wings exported by the South American country, according to a statement sent to Reuters by Brazil\u2019s Agriculture Ministry. The request was made during a meeting in the city of Shenzhen, in Guangdong province, where Brazilian agriculture attach\u00e9s met local health and trade officials on Tuesday, the statement said. In response, according to the statement, the Chinese participants said the results are being kept by health authorities of Guangdong, who did not participate in the meeting. The Brazilians said they would continue to liaise with China\u2019s municipal, provincial and central governments to obtain the lab reports as well as other relevant information pertaining to the case. The contamination claim concerns chicken wings produced at a Brazilian poultry plant. Aurora, the company which operates the facility in Southern Brazil, voluntarily suspended poultry exports to China effective 20 August pending more clarifications regarding the alleged contamination. According to the Brazilian government, Chinese officials at the meeting said three samples had tested positive for Covid-19: one taken from the chicken wings, and two from the packaging of products coming from Aurora\u2019s plant in the town of Xaxim. \u201cThe health authorities in Shenzhen were unable to say whether the findings concerned only the detection of the virus\u2019 genetic material or the active virus, nor were they able to provide further information about the alleged finding,\u201d the statement said. The alleged contamination led the Philippines to impose a temporary ban on poultry meat imports from Brazil while Hong Kong halted chicken imports from Aurora\u2019s Xaxim facility.       9.19pm BST       The rapid pace of Covid-19 vaccine development and scant information about the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) vaccine review process are leading to concerns, the American Medical Association (AMA) said. In a letter, the AMA urged the FDA to ensure transparency in the vaccine development process and keep physicians informed of the agency\u2019s plan for review of potential vaccine candidates.  Vaccine hesitancy among the public appears to be reaching unprecedented levels due to a number of factors including significant spread of misinformation through channels such as social media, according to the AMA. In April, the US government initiated Operation Warp Speed and has so far invested billions to secure doses of potential vaccines from across the world. Warp Speed aims to expedite development of a vaccine and therapies to treat Covid-19, and the emphasis on speed has provoked public anxiety about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. Earlier this month, Russia became the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing. However, experts have warned against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. In August, top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said the FDA was not cutting corners on safety in its review of vaccine candidates for Covid-19.       9.13pm BST       The traditional end-of-summer commuter crush appears unlikely to materialise in the UK next week as companies and staff shun the office and embrace remote working, prompting a warning from the country\u2019s leading business body about the future of firms that rely on passing trade. Hundreds of thousands of mostly white-collar workers are expected to continue working from home, in some cases permanently, despite the reopening of schools in England over the next fortnight. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 firms, has called on businesses and the government to strike a balance to ensure outlets in sparsely populated city centres do not face oblivion. The CBI\u2019s deputy director general, Josh Hardie, said:  Remote working has been a real success for many firms and employees, and none of the many benefits should be lost,\u201d said the. But there has also been a knock-on effect to our town and city centres, where many businesses dependent on passing trade face an uphill battle just to survive. Both the government and business have a role to play in supporting more people back to the workplace safely and securely. Things won\u2019t return to how businesses operated pre-Covid-19, nor should they. But there is a middle ground to find as the economy reopens.    Related: Firms urged to find 'middle ground' on return to UK offices         9.11pm BST       As many as 30 teenagers in the UK who took a holiday to the Greek island of Zante may have contracted coronavirus, health officials have said. At least 11 of a group of 18- and 19-year-olds in Plymouth have tested positive for Covid-19 and some had been for a night out in the Devon city since their return from their holiday. The council\u2019s public health director, Ruth Harrell, said her team was working alongside the national systems to contact and trace the young people thought to have been affected. \u201cWe know that some of these young people had no symptoms, and so carried on as normal, including a night out in Plymouth\u2019s bars and restaurants, until they became aware of the risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means more people could be infected.

The forced exit of a heavyweight from the bloc\u2019s executive will be a credibility blow for the team led by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for less than a year. The Commission will play a key role in pushing across the line a \u20ac750bn recovery fund for EU economies hammered by the coronavirus crisis, and Hogan himself had been making headway in fraught trade talks with the United States. Hogan said in a statement:  It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead. I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland - the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life - caused such concern, unease and upset.  Hogan attended a golf dinner last week that outraged the Irish public and led to the resignation of an Irish minister and the disciplining of several lawmakers. He had insisted on Tuesday that he adhered to all rules during the trip.   Related: EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan resigns after flouting Covid rules      Updated at 9.46pm BST     9.04pm BST       Canada\u2019s National Research Council (NRC) has ended its partnership for a coronavirus vaccine with CanSino Biologics, saying the Chinese company lacks the authority to ship the vaccine at this time. CanSino in May had agreed to bring its vaccine candidate to Canada for testing through a partnership with the (NRC). Because of the delay, NRC \u201chas since moved on to focus our team and facilities on other partners,\u201d the organisation said in a statement to Reuters. \u201cThe process is not clear to the NRC, but CanSino does not have the authority to ship the vaccine at this time,\u201d said NRC in its statement. Earlier, CanSino cited bureaucratic indecision as the reason behind the failure for its vaccine partnership in Canada, the Globe and Mail reported, quoting the company\u2019s chief executive officer. Decisions in China on whether to send the vaccine to Canada were \u201ccaught in the bureaucracy\u201d, and some divisions of the Chinese government were not clear if the vaccine should \u201cgo to global trials or how to handle it\u201d, chairman and CEO of CanSino Biologics, Dr Xuefeng Yu, told the Globe and Mail in an interview.  NRC said its agreement with CanSino had been reviewed by the company\u2019s Chinese government collaborators.  After the agreement was signed, the Chinese government changed the process required to ship vaccines to other countries. CanSino\u2019s vaccine candidate is one of the few being tested in a late-stage study, as companies race to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19. It is based on a modified version of a common cold virus called adenovirus type 5 that was first developed by a Canadian researcher, Frank Graham. CanSino\u2019s Yu is a former Sanofi Canada executive. The company had previously worked with NRC on an Ebola vaccine based on the same technology, and with other Canadian researchers on an experimental tuberculosis vaccine. Quebec-based Medicago is the only Canadian company with an experimental vaccine in human trials, with several other projects in earlier stages of development. The federal government recently announced deals to buy vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer.        8.40pm BST       A hurried evacuation of a half million Texas and Louisiana residents ahead of Hurricane Laura has clogged highways, while Covid-19 precautions slowed public transportation for evacuees who needed it and complicated temporary housing arrangements. The storm strengthened and is forecast to bring 145 mile (233km) per hour winds to the Texas/Louisiana border near midnight on Wednesday.  Warnings for an \u201cunsurvivable storm surge\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d led officials in each state to call for residents to flee inland. Local officials advised residents with personal vehicles to take them. For those boarding buses out of the area temperature checks were required. Evacuees were being assigned to far-flung hotels to avoid large groups at shelters.    In Galveston County, Texas, which ordered a mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas on Tuesday, buses brought residents inland, but capped the number on each at 15 to 20 people because of the pandemic, said county official Zach Davidson.  Officials also arranged for ambulances for those diagnosed with Covid-19. \u201cWe have stressed to people, when you\u2019re building your hurricane kit, put in a mask, hand sanitiser, gloves,\u201d he said. Texas state officials were directing those fleeing the storm to hotels in Dallas and elsewhere after an Austin intake centre was overwhelmed with requests for housing overnight.    Evacuee Veronica Carresco was carting a full complement of antiseptics on the way to Midland, Texas. \u201cWe\u2019re just being cautious. Masks, Lysol, hand sanitiser - we\u2019re doing all of it,\u201d she said. Large-scale evacuations could increase Covid-19 cases in evacuees\u2019 origin and destination counties, according to a study by Columbia University and the Union of Concerned Scientists. It advised evacuees to be assigned to areas with low virus activity and encouraged them to follow social distancing guidelines and to wear masks and protective gear. Texas and Louisiana were both hot spots for the pandemic earlier this year, but new case trends have since declined.       8.25pm BST       Peru has begun registering volunteers for clinical trials of a Chinese vaccine against the coronavirus. Six thousand volunteers, who must be aged between 18 and 75 and not have contracted the virus, will be recruited by Cayetano Heredia and San Marcos universities via a dedicated website. \u201cThe universities will select 3,000 volunteers each,\u201d San Marcos rector Orestes Cachay told reporters. The vaccine, being developed by Chinese company Sinopharm, will be administered by injection. According to Peruvian researchers in charge of the clinical trials, two strains of the virus - the Wuhan strain and Beijing strain - and a placebo will be randomly given to volunteers. \u201cA technical team from China will arrive in the coming days, totalling 38 people, to implement the operational part of the project,\u201d Cachay told TV channel N. The trial is expected to last until December President Martin Vizcarra announced last week the country would participate in clinical trials of vaccines being developed in China, Britain, the United States and Germany. Peru, with a population of 33 million, has the third-highest number of deaths from the pandemic in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico. Per capita, it has the region\u2019s highest death rate, with 843.5 deaths per million inhabitants. More than 28,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the country, which has registered more than 600,000 infections so far.       7.51pm BST       Moderna said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine induced immune responses in older adults similar to those in younger participants, offering hope it will be effective in people considered to be at high risk for severe complications from the virus. The company is one of the leading contenders in the race to develop a vaccine against the virus that has killed more than 820,000 people worldwide.  Its candidate, mRNA-1273, is already in late-stage human trials testing its ability to safely prevent infection. Moderna said the immune responses in those aged between ages 56 and 70, above age 70 and those 18 to 55-years-old were similar. Health officials have been concerned about whether vaccine candidates would work in older people, whose immune systems typically do not respond as strongly to vaccines. The company has so far enrolled over 13,000 participants in its late-stage study. About 18% of the total participants are Black, Latino, Native American or Alaska Native, groups that have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and are often under represented in clinical trials. Dr Jacqueline Miller, Moderna\u2019s head of infectious disease development, said the company plans to post weekly updates on enrolment of Black and Latino trial subjects on its website. Pfizer told Reuters last week that 19% of the 11,000 subjects already enrolled in its vaccine trial are Black or Latino.       7.19pm BST       The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention narrowed its guidance for who should get tested for Covid-19 this week, saying those who were exposed but are not symptomatic may not need to be tested. That is a reversal from its previous recommendation, which said testing is recommended for all close contact of people diagnosed with Covid-19.  US government health officials said the guidelines should not be interpreted as \u201cinhibiting public health.\u201d They said the new guidelines were a collaboration between the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the two other agencies. The Trump administration has been criticised for its handling of testing for Covid-19, with many states falling short of the volume of tests needed to contain the virus.  It has also been criticised for wielding too heavy a hand with the CDC on previous guidelines such as for schools reopening. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the move looked political. \u201cThis is not science. It\u2019s politics,\u201d he tweeted.     The CDC reversed its guidance to say that people in close contact with a COVID-positive person don&#39;t need to get tested.This is not science. It\u2019s politics. Politics that are dangerous to public health.It&#39;s indefensible.&mdash; Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) August 26, 2020      Updated at 7.54pm BST     7.18pm BST    France reports 5,429 new coronavirus infections, new post-lockdown high    The French health ministry has registered 5,429 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, a new post-lockdown high and a level of new infections not seen since the height of the epidemic in early April. The daily figure has topped 4,000 several times in recent days, ahead of the 1 September return to school for millions of pupils. The French public must act in \u201ca spirit of responsibility\u201d to limit the surge in new cases, prime minister Jean Castex said on France Inter radio Wednesday morning. \u201cThe state has its share of responsiblity... but everyone has to feel like it\u2019s their job to fight the pandemic,\u201d Castex added The total number of people infected with the virus in France now stands at 253,587. On Monday, German health authorities labelled the \u00cele-de-France region including capital Paris and the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region around Mediterranean port city Marseille \u201crisk zones\u201d for the virus. Anyone travelling to Germany from the two regions must submit to a Covid-19 test and quarantine themselves while awaiting the result. The health ministry said figures for the cumulative death toll and for Covid-19 hospitalisations for Wednesday were not available yet due to a technical glitch. On Tuesday, the ministry reported the cumulative number of deaths had risen by 16 to 30,544 and it said 4,600 people were in hospital with Covid-19, including 410 in intensive care.

Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.comTwitter: @journojess_       6.56pm BST       Qatar has decided to reopen all mosques across the country for daily and Friday prayers from 1 September a statement by the supreme committee for crisis management announced on Wednesday. The statement said this would be part of the fourth and final phase of a plan that started on 15 June, aimed at gradually lifting coronavirus restrictions.         6.54pm BST    Summary     Italy recorded its highest daily tally in coronavirus infections since May when the country was still in lockdown. A further 1,367 cases brought the total to 262,540. Despite the surge in infections, the government insists there are no plans for a new lockdown. Croatia reported its highest number of daily cases amid the summer tourism season. New cases have risen since Croatia opened its borders to tourists for the summer, hitting more than 200 daily in late August and a record 358 on Wednesday. The government said it still hopes to tackle the crisis without curfews if people would \u201cobey the rules and act responsibly\u201d. Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19. Early-stage clinical trials on the vaccine, developed by the Vector virology institute in Siberia, would be completed by the end of September. Western experts have been sceptical about Russia\u2019s approval of Sputnik V, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. Germany will stop mandatory tests for travellers from high-risk areas and require them to quarantine for at least five days instead as it focuses its testing strategy on people with symptoms or possible exposure to patients with Covid-19. The change in strategy is partly down to Germany\u2019s labs reaching the limits of their capacities. The World Economic Forum has postponed its upcoming annual meeting in Davos until summer next year. Organisers said experts advised it would not be safe for the forum to go ahead as planned in January amid the pandemic. Belgium revised down its Covid-19 death toll, just as it was about to pass the milestone of 10,000 fatalities. Health authorities reviewed figures from care homes in Flanders and found some Covid-19 deaths not reported as such, some recorded twice and some not caused by coronavirus. The net effect is a reduction of 121, bringing the tally to 9,878. The French prime minister said life must return to some kind of normality whilst avoiding another nationwide lockdown. Jean Castex said his government wanted to ensure the French could return to school, get back to work and enjoy a social life \u201cas normally as possible\u201d. He added face masks would remain central to the government\u2019s strategy after a surge in the rate of coronavirus infections in recent weeks. Kenya extended a nationwide curfew for 30 days as coronavirus cases rose in areas outside the capital. The president Uhuru Kenyatta also ordered bars and nightclubs shut for another 30 days, but increased the number of people allowed to attend weddings, funerals and other events. Ukraine has imposed a temporary ban on most foreigners from entering the country until 28 September. Lockdown measures have also been extended until the end of October to contain a recent surge in coronavirus cases.  Lebanon could \u2018lose control\u2019 of its coronavirus outbreak, the caretaker prime minister warned. Hassan Diab said that if cases continued to rise greatly, as they have in the wake of the Beirut explosion, \u201cwe will lose control of this epidemic\u201d. Myanmar ordered all schools to close after reporting a record daily rise in new coronavirus infections. The authorities are trying to tackle a resurgence of the virus - with 70 new cases recorded on Wednesday - following weeks without confirmed domestic transmission. Iran\u2019s death toll exceeded 21,000 as cases continue to rise. Another 119 infections took the tally to 21,020, prompting the government to urge people to \u201cavoid unnecessary trips\u201d. A 61-year-old man died in Gaza after contracting the virus, as Palestinian authorities clamped down on an outbreak in the enclave. It was the first death among the general population since an infected woman died at a quarantine centre in March.  That\u2019s it from me, Lucy Campbell, \u2018til tomorrow. Thank you so much, as ever, to everybody who got in touch throughout the day and sent through tips - your contributions are greatly appreciated!       6.21pm BST       Norway has said it will impose a 10-day quarantine on all people arriving from Germany and Liechtenstein from 29 August due to rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in those countries. Similar restrictions will also be imposed on those coming from two additional regions in Sweden, the Norwegian foreign ministry said in a statement. To try to prevent a domestic resurgence of the coronavirus, Norway quarantines all travellers from countries with more than 20 confirmed new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population during the past two weeks. It also advices against travel to those nations. With its latest additions, Norway will be restricting travel from most European countries, including France, Britain, Spain, Poland and Switzerland. It still allows quarantine-free travel from EU countries Italy, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Finland and the Baltic states as well as some parts of Denmark and Sweden.       6.20pm BST       Portugal\u2019s government has reported a public deficit of 8.3 billion euros between January and July this year, over 17 times higher compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Total revenues fell 10.5% and tax revenues dropped 14.6% as a consequence of a \u201ccontraction of the economic activity\u201d, the finance ministry said in a statement, adding expenditures grew 6.9% due to, among other things, subsidies for the unemployment and ill people. The ministry said:  Budget execution highlights the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and public services following the adoption of mitigation policy measures.  The outbreak is set to leave long-lasting scars on Portugal\u2019s tourism-dependent economy, with the central bank expecting it to contract 9.5% this year. Last year, the country reported 2.2% growth and a budget surplus of 0.2% of gross domestic product.        6.19pm BST       Germany has issued a travel warnings for Andorra and Gibraltar due to rising coronavirus infections, the foreign ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday. The foreign ministry said it was also warning against unnecessary tourist trips to Saint Martin and Guadeloupe as well as Aruba and Saint Maarten.        6.13pm BST       Spain reported another 3,594 coronavirus cases on Wednesday as it struggled to contain a second wave of contagion that hit a peak of some 8,000 cases last Friday. The country has registered the largest number of cases in western Europe since the pandemic began six months ago and the biggest resurgence after lifting one of the continent\u2019s strictest lockdowns against the spread of Covid-19. The latest daily increase was below the roughly 4,000 cases recorded a day earlier, according to updated health ministry data, and brought the cumulative total to 419,849. Seven more deaths were recorded, pushing the overall toll to 28,971. Daily numbers can still be retroactively updated. Accounting for 1,513 cases, the Madrid capital region was by far the hardest hit. Separate data from regional authorities showed several municipalities with more than 700 cases per 100,000 people - more than seven times the national average for the past week. While officials have advised residents in some areas to stay at home, the Madrid region\u2019s deputy leader said there were no plans to request a localised state of emergency under new powers granted by the central government. Ignacio Aguado told a news conference:  Generally speaking I\u2019m not in favour of more lockdowns, of repeating the steps from March and April...That ended in economic ruin.  He also hit out at the central government\u2019s lack of a strategy to safely reopen schools, accusing the education ministry of leaving local authorities to fend for themselves. In the absence of national guidelines, Spain\u2019s 17 regions have been left to develop their own plans, frustrating parents and teachers and prompting students to call for three days of strikes in September. Student union leader Coral Latorre told state broadcaster TVE:  We\u2019re here to demand that the ministry of education does something, because we\u2019re pulling our hair out here to see they\u2019ve done absolutely nothing over the past five months.        5.56pm BST    Italy hits new record in daily cases since May    Italy reported 1,367 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since May when the country was still in lockdown, bringing the total number to 262,540.  Authorities have also registered the highest number of tests: 93,529, almost 20,000 more than Tuesday and a record since the beginning of the pandemic.  Thirteen more people have died with the virus in the last 24 hours, and the death toll now stands at 35,458.  Despite the surge in infections, the government insists there are no plans for a new lockdown.  Health authorities are particularly concerned about a cluster that emerged in the Sardinian \u2018Billionaire\u2019 nightclub, owned by former Formula 1 team boss and Italian businessman, Flavio Briatore, who has been hospitalised in Milan after contracting coronavirus.  More than 60 people tested positive for Covid-19 at Billionaire\u2019s, as authorities are struggling to find and test thousands of customers who have been at the Briatore\u2019s nightclub in the last weeks.    Updated at 5.59pm BST     5.32pm BST       The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has said his government will provide as much as C$2 billion to help students safely return to schools as the country prepares for a return to classes amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOur children must be safe in the classroom. That\u2019s non-negotiable ,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. Announcing the funding at a school gymnasium in north Toronto, Trudeau emphasised the importance of a safe reopening and said the funding could be used for distance learning and disinfectants.  Parents and staff are anxious about what the school year may hold. As a dad\u2014and a former teacher\u2014 I get that. We all want what\u2019s best for our kids, including a good education. School matters.  The billions in funding is a rare step by the federal government into education, a provincial jurisdiction, underscoring the unprecedented nature of school reopening.  The announcement also comes weeks, if not days, before schools across the country welcome back students, raising questions about the timing of the federal government\u2019s plans. Trudeau has faced accusations from political rivals in recent days that he is looking to buy political points ahead of parliament\u2019s return and a possible election. While Canada has seen a relatively low growth rate in new coronavirus cases throughout the summer, experts fear a rushed or ill-planned return to school could reverse the success in reining in the virus. As school boards across the country scramble to finalise their return strategies, many have been forced to amend their plans in response to fears from parents and educators. A number of boards across the country have announced they will delay the start of school, stagger the return of students and make masks mandatory for all grade levels.       5.09pm BST           Updated at 6.09pm BST     5.09pm BST       The UK\u2019s second-busiest airport, Gatwick, announced 600 job cuts because of the collapse in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airport, south of London, said the losses, which represent nearly a quarter of its workforce, come as August passenger numbers plunged 80% compared with last year. Chief executive Stewart Wingate said:  If anyone is any doubt about the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry, then today\u2019s news ... is a stark reminder.  We are in ongoing talks with [UK] government to see what sector-specific support can be put in place for the industry at this time.  The slump amid the global pandemic has forced Gatwick to operate from just one of its two terminals, and the airport is operating at 20% of capacity. More than 75% of staff are on furlough. Wingate promised management would try to safeguard as many jobs as possible and said restructuring would lead to a \u201cfitter and stronger organisation\u201d.    In late July, Heathrow - the country\u2019s busiest airport - announced a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.1 billion in the first six months of 2020. Revenues halved year-on-year while passenger numbers fell 96% in the second quarter, as air travel came to a virtual standstill due to lockdowns around the world. The airport, which directly employs 7,000 staff, began voluntary redundancies and reduced its management by a third. It also cut operating costs by at least \u00a3300 million and cancelled or paused over \u00a3650 million in projects.       5.03pm BST       Romanian theatres and cinemas could reopen from 1 September with social distancing restrictions and protective masks, while the return of indoor restaurants depends on the number of new coronavirus cases in each region, the president said on Wednesday. Romania has been reporting just over 1,000 new cases per day since late July, bringing confirmed cases to 81,646 since the pandemic reached the country in late February. Some 3,421 people have died, and Romania has extended a state of alert until the middle of September. Indoor restaurants, cinemas and theatres have been closed since March. \u201cThere are two sectors where I feel it is important that activity resumes, as much as possible under safe conditions,\u201d the president Klaus Iohannis told reporters.  After 1 Sepember, indoor restaurants could open taking into account the epidemiological conditions in each town.  Iohannis added the government would decide the conditions on Thursday. Romanian schools will reopen on 14 September on a case-by-case basis, with towns affected by the pandemic likely to hold classes online. The European Union state will hold a local election on 27 September, with a parliamentary election likely in December.       4.37pm BST    Croatia reports record daily rise in infections amid summer tourist season    Croatia has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus infections as a tricky summer tourism season brings a resurgence of Covid-19 to the Adriatic country. The nation of 4.2 million braved the first few months of the pandemic without strict lockdown measures, recording fewer than 100 cases daily for several months and then almost no new infections by mid-May. But new cases have risen since Croatia opened its borders to tourists for the summer season, hitting more than 200 daily in late August and a record 358 on Wednesday. In recent days, countries such as the UK and Germany have imposed quarantines and other measures for travellers returning from parts of Croatia, while Italy blamed a new cluster of the virus on tourists coming back from the Balkan country. The government said on Wednesday it still hopes to tackle the crisis without curfews. \u201cThe only option not to impose complete lockdown is to obey the rules and act responsibly,\u201d said Davor Bozinovic, head of the national Covid-19 response team. Around a third of the new cases were detected along Croatia\u2019s southern coast, where the crystal clear waters of the Adriatic and idyllic islands are a huge tourist draw. The government admits it has taken risks in an effort to save tourism, which accounts for a fifth of the economy. \u201cIt was, let\u2019s be completely frank, a clear political goal of the Croatian government for the tourism season to be as good at it can be in these circumstances,\u201d prime minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 said last week. In July, tourist arrivals were slightly under half of last year\u2019s figure, a rate officials hailed as \u201cexcellent\u201d under the circumstances. In total, the authorities have reported 8,800 infections and 174 deaths from the respiratory disease since February.    Updated at 4.58pm BST     4.23pm BST    Russia prepares to approve second vaccine    Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19 in late September or early October, the Russian deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, said on Wednesday. Speaking at a televised government meeting, Golikova told the president, Vladimir Putin, that early-stage clinical trials on the vaccine, developed by the Vector virology institute in Siberia, would be completed by the end of September. \u201cAs of today there have been no complications among those vaccinated in the first and second stages of testing,\u201d she said.Earlier this month, Russia became the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing. The vaccine, called \u201cSputnik V\u201d in homage to the world\u2019s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, has been hailed as safe and effective by Russian authorities. But western experts have been sceptical about Russia\u2019s approval of Sputnik V, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. RDIF, Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, said on Wednesday the final phase of clinical trials on Sputnik V were beginning. It said 40,000 people would take part in the final trials and that similar trials would also be carried out in five other countries. Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, said residents of the Russian capital could apply to take part in the trials. These final trials, carried out on a large number of people, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval.

Handing back to my colleague Lucy Campbell now.        3.26pm BST       The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, appears to have employed the services of a celebrity personal trainer after admitting he needed to lose weight after contracting Covid-19. Harry Jameson, who describes himself as an \u201celite performance coach\u201d, was snapped running alongside Johnson in central London by a photographer from London\u2019s Evening Standard newspaper today.  A UK government source told the Evening Standard: \u201cYes, he has engaged a personal trainer. I can confirm it is Harry Jameson. It\u2019s because he is really serious about getting fit, as anyone who has seen him over the past couple of months knows. Boris is raring to go.\u201d  Johnson spoke publicly last month about his wish to get into better shape, and admitted that being overweight probably played a factor in the severity of his illness. He was admitted to intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London in April and received oxygen as he fought the virus.    Updated at 3.29pm BST     3.12pm BST       Germany will stop mandatory tests for travellers from high-risk areas and require them to quarantine for at least five days instead as it focuses its testing strategy on people with symptoms or possible exposure to Covid-19 patients, the country\u2019s health minister said today.  Jens Spahn said that over the summer vacation period the number of virus tests performed in Germany nearly doubled to 900,000 a week, in part to identify people who caught the virus during trips abroad, the Associated Press agency reports.  People coming home from coronavirus risk areas were offered free tests at airports, train stations and highway stops, allowing them to cut short the required two-week quarantine if their result came back negative. But now, travellers returning from high-risk areas, which include most countries outside the European Union and some regions inside the bloc, will be required to go into mandatory quarantines for at least five days before taking a test, which may no longer be free unless ordered by a doctor. The change in the country\u2019s testing strategy is also due to Germany\u2019s labs reaching the limits of their capacities, Spahn said. With the end of the vacation period \u2026 this risk is going down again, Spahn told reporters in Berlin. We have to focus more on patients with symptoms and those who had contact with Covid patients. Spahn did not say when the testing strategy would change, but it is likely the decision will be made at a meeting on Thursday between chancellor Angela Merkel and the country\u2019s 16 state governors.

You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com       2.28pm BST    Annual meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos delayed until summer 2021    The World Economic Forum has decided to postpone its upcoming annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, out of caution amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The meeting, originally scheduled for January 2021, will be rescheduled to \u201cearly next summer\u201d, according to organisers. Adrian Monck, managing director of public engagement at the Forum, said in a press release:  The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the \u2018Great Reset\u2019 in the post-Covid-19 era is so urgent. However, the advice from experts is what we cannot do so safely in January.

Health authorities reviewed figures from care homes in the northern region of Flanders and found some Covid-19 deaths not reported as such, some recorded twice and some not caused by coronavirus. The net effect is a reduction of 121. The revision brought the total fatalities to 9,878 by Wednesday. Otherwise, it would have been 9,999. The UK government lowered England\u2019s death toll by more than 5,000 two weeks ago after the government adopted a new method of counting fatalities. Belgium\u2019s Covid-19 deaths per capita are among the highest in the world and it reports a higher proportion of fatalities in care homes than other countries, including when the disease is suspected but not confirmed. The Belgian Covid-19 taskforce spokesman and virologist Steven Van Gucht told Reuters TV the country had been hit hard. \u201cBut if you compare Belgium with, for example, the United Kingdom or Spain you see they were actually hit even worse,\u201d he said, adding this was reflected in \u201cexcess\u201d mortality rates. The number of new cases in Belgium has risen steadily from a low of about 80 per day in early July to an average of 490 for the week of 16-22 August, although numbers had been falling for 10 days. Van Gucht said about a fifth of new infections appeared to have been caught on summer holidays. A new challenge would come from reopening schools and a public tiring of measures among the strictest in Europe.  This is a matter of prevention \u2026 This is really to avoid a problem that will only come in a few weeks or a few months.     Updated at 2.15pm BST     1.47pm BST    French PM says life must return to some kind of normality    France will not let its guard down against a still-virulent coronavirus but life must return to some kind of normality, the prime minister said on Wednesday, as a senior adviser to the government warned of a second wave in November. Jean Castex, the prime minister, said his government wanted to ensure the French could return to school, get back to work and enjoy a social life \u201cas normally as possible\u201d. Face masks would remain central to the government\u2019s strategy after a surge in the rate of coronavirus infections in recent weeks, he said. Castex told France Inter radio:  The worst thing of all would be that we sink because we did not get things moving amid a social and economic crisis.     France has the seventh-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world, with 30,544 fatalities. It reported 3,304 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, below last week\u2019s daily highs but much higher than after the president, Emmanuel Macron, initially eased a nationwide lockdown. Pupils in France aged 11 and over must wear masks when they return to school on 1 September and masks will be provided for free to those with health risks or from impoverished families. The country has also made it mandatory to wear a mask in workplaces from next week to counter the rise in infections as employees return from their summer holidays.    Countries across Europe are grappling with how reboot their economies and get the daily lives of citizens as close to normal as possible without accelerating the spread of the virus. Underlining the delicate balancing act, the head of the scientific council advising France\u2019s government said a second wave of the coronavirus could hit in November. \u201cWe may have to toughen measures again,\u201d said Castex, who said local lockdowns would be imposed if needed. The government\u2019s delayed \u20ac100bn ($118.07bn) recovery plan will be unveiled on 3 September, he added.    Updated at 2.16pm BST     1.35pm BST       Kenya\u2019s president has extended a nationwide curfew for 30 days, saying coronavirus cases were rising in areas outside the capital. In a televised address, Uhuru Kenyatta also ordered bars and nightclubs shut for another 30 days - but increased the number of people allowed to attend weddings, funerals and other events. He said infections were slowing in Nairobi and the port and tourism hub of Mombasa.  He said:  This crisis has however began to percolate to the counties. The new frontier of this invisible enemy is increasingly shifting to the counties and to our rural areas.  At present Kenya has 33,016 cases of coronavirus, 564 deaths and 19,296 recoveries.       1.32pm BST       It will be mandatory for pupils to wear face masks in communal areas of secondary schools in England in places with local lockdowns, the UK education minister Gavin Williamson said on Wednesday in a government U-turn on enforcing their use.   Related: Education secretary defends school face masks U-turn after Tory backlash    After failing to persuade schools to bring back all students before the summer, the prime minister Boris Johnson is keen to make sure the reopening now happens as he urges people to get back to some kind of normality after the coronavirus lockdown. Ministers had ruled out the need for pupils to wear masks in corridors despite updated advice from the World Health Organization at the weekend, but Wednesday\u2019s move shifted that stance. Williamson told Sky News:  There are some areas of the country where we have had to do local lockdowns and we think it is right in those few areas that in secondary schools, in communal areas, that youngsters do wear face coverings.  On a school visit, Johnson later told students:   The risk to your health is not from Covid ... the greatest risk you face now is of continuing to be out of school. That is why in the next week, in the succeeding days, we must have every pupil back in school in the way that you\u2019ve come back to school.  Headteachers in other areas will also have the discretion to recommend using masks in their schools for students aged between 11 and 18. It is the latest U-turn by Johnson\u2019s government which has come under fire for its handling of the pandemic and after a debacle this month when an algorithm-based system saw swathes of pupils awarded lower-than-expected exam grades.   Related: From face masks to Covid testing: 11 times the UK government has U-turned    The change on stance on masks also marks the latest occasion when Johnson has followed the devolved Scottish government in revising pandemic rules, after changes to the grading of exams and enforcing face coverings in shops.   Related: How England follows Scotland's lead over Covid-19    Huw Merriman, chairman of parliament\u2019s transport select committee and a member of Johnson\u2019s party, said it felt like the government was making it up as it went along. He told BBC Radio:  It\u2019s time we stopped hiding behind the science, which keeps changing, and we focus on the fact that we are in charge.  Williamson, who apologised after the exam grade problems, said the shift on masks had come following the change in WHO advice.

Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, also said the government would need to take a decision on Thursday on whether to ban major public events in September.    Updated at 1.22pm BST     12.21pm BST       The city of Berlin has banned demonstrations planned for this weekend to oppose measures imposed to stem the coronavirus pandemic, after organisers of a rally earlier this month failed to ensure marchers wore masks and kept their distance. Andreas Geisel, the Berlin interior senator, said the authorities had to strike a balance between the right to freedom of assembly and the need to protect people against infection. He said:  We are still in the middle of a pandemic with rising infection figures.  Germany has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared with some other large European countries, but the number of new daily cases has been rising steadily since early July and has accelerated in recent weeks. About 20,000 people, included libertarians, constitutional loyalists, far-right supporters and anti-vaccination activists, marched in the capital on 1 August. Geisel said the organisers of that protest had deliberately broken the rules they had previously accepted in talks with police, including the wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. \u201cSuch behaviour is not acceptable. The state cannot be given the runaround,\u201d he said, adding he did not want Berlin to be a stage for conspiracy theorists and rightwing extremists. If crowds still gather despite the ban, the police will intervene, he said.    \ud83d\udd34 Berlin verbietet #Corona-#Demonstrationen.

Lebanon registered 525 new Covid-19 infections and 12 deaths on Tuesday. The country experienced a rise in infections following the catastrophic explosion in the capital city at the start of the month. Cases doubled in the two weeks following the blast, as infections spread in hospitals where victims were being treated, medics say. The government imposed a partial lockdown last Friday to help combat community spread. But the shutdown, which includes a curfew from 6pm to 6am, still allows for clearing rubble, making repairs and giving out aid in neighbourhoods damaged by the explosion. The airport will remain open, with travellers having to take PCR tests before boarding and on arriving in the country. The health minister for Lebanon\u2019s caretaker government, Hamad Hassan, who also spoke to the council, said the tally of cases was concerning. Hassan added that hospital capacity needed to be increased to help combat the rise in cases, the official said.      Updated at 12.21pm BST     12.10pm BST    Myanmar to closes all schools after highest daily rise in infections    Myanmar ordered all schools to close after reporting 70 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise, as authorities try to tackle a resurgence of the virus following weeks without confirmed domestic transmission. All but one of the new cases announced on Wednesday were in the western state of Rakhine, found in nine different locations, each linked to an outbreak in the state capital, Sittwe, where a lockdown and curfew were imposed last week. Myanmar\u2019s outbreaks has been relatively small compared with other countries in the region, with six deaths and 574 infections in total, but an increase in Covid-19 cases by nearly 35% in just over a week is causing some concern.    \u201cWe have called all the schools and instructed them to close from tomorrow,\u201d Ko Layy Win, director general of the country\u2019s department of basic education, told Reuters.  The central committee of Covid decided to do that since the local transmission in the country is high.  One of Wednesday\u2019s cases was in the biggest city Yangon, in an individual seeking medical clearance to travel. The virus resurfaced in Myanmar on 16 August after a month without community transmission, with the majority of those cases in Sittwe.    Sittwe is also home to crowded camps where about 100,000 Rohingya Muslims have been confined since violence erupted in 2012. Rohingya mostly face strict curbs on freedom of movement and access to healthcare. Myanmar has restricted internet access in much of the region on security grounds. Humanitarian workers have urged the authorities to restore it at higher speeds to ensure reliable health information is available. Among the 179 domestic infections since early last week, authorities have detected a mutation thought to be more contagious than previously seen in Myanmar. To keep Covid-19 at bay, Myanmar has since late March closed its borders to all but returning citizens, who are required to undergo quarantine.    Updated at 12.22pm BST     11.48am BST       Sweden has withdrawn its advice against unnecessary travel to the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Romania. Sweden earlier withdrew advice against unnecessary trips to Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Vatican and Austria. The foreign ministry in a statement on its website extended its advice against travel to other EU and Schengen countries and Britain until 9 September, and to the rest of the world until 15 November. Rising numbers of confirmed cases in some countries are fuelling fears of a resurgence in the spread of Covid-19.

Updated at 11.56am BST     11.30am BST    Iran's death toll exceeds 21,000 as cases continue to rise    Iran\u2019s death toll from coronavirus rose by 119 to 21,020, the health ministry\u2019s spokeswoman told state TV on Wednesday, with the total number of identified cases rising to 365,606. Sima Sadat Lari said that 2,243 new cases were identified in the past 24 hours in Iran, rising from 2,213 a day earlier. Lari said:  Unfortunately we have been facing a surge in coronavirus infections in recent weeks. I urge everyone to avoid unnecessary trips.  Iran\u2019s top health officials have appealed to Iranians to avoid travelling during the Shia Muslim religious holiday of Ashura later this week to avoid the risk of a fresh surge of infections. Ashura is the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram when, according to Islamic tradition, Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Mohammed, was killed in battle in 680. But despite warnings by the authorities against travelling, state media reported heavy traffic on roads leading to the Caspian coast in northern Iran, a favourite destination during holidays.    Updated at 11.34am BST     11.26am BST       A 61-year-old man has died in the Gaza Strip after contracting the coronavirus, Palestinian authorities said on Wednesday as they clamped down on an outbreak in the enclave. The man had suffered previous illnesses and had been on a respirator, the health ministry said. It was the first death among the general population since an infected woman died at a quarantine centre in March.    Health officials said nine more cases were discovered on Wednesday. Six of them were in the isolated Maghazi refugee camp where a first four cases had been confirmed on Monday, prompting Gaza\u2019s Hamas authorities to impose a full lockdown. The three other cases were in northern Gaza Strip, indicating the virus has begun to spread into different areas of the enclave of 2 million people.    The outbreak outside Maghazi remains slow but it cemented concerns by local and international health organisations over the territory\u2019s potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital capacity. With local authorities maintaining a lockdown in all cities, people were instructed to stay home at all times and to wear face masks if, in cases of extreme necessity, they had to go out.    The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which helps over half of Gaza\u2019s population, said it was looking into alternative plans to continue health, education and food services to beneficiaries should the lockdown be extended. Adnan Abu Hasna, UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said clinics remained open but physical presence was prohibited, instead staffers were providing medical consultation over the phone and some medication was delivered to patients at home. Abus Hasna said:  We are in constant consultation with the health ministry and we are also in discussion over the implementation of our own alternative plans in order to ensure the continuation of delivering services to refugees.  Monday\u2019s cases were uncovered after a woman traveled to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where she tested positive, the Gaza health ministry said.  A ministry spokesman urged everyone who might have visited a supermarket outside a hospital in central Gaza to quarantine themselves and report to medics immediately.

Updated at 9.31am BST     8.45am BST       The German government has agreed to pump another \u20ac10bn into its Covid-hit economy, prolonging a short-time work scheme and freezing insolvency rules. Short-time work saves jobs by allowing employers to reduce the employees\u2019 hours but keeps them in work. That programme had been due to expire in March 2021 and will now be extended until the end of next year. Bridging aid for small and mid-sized companies will now be extended until the end of this year too. The latest \u20ac10bn pledge comes on top of a massive stimulus package, worth more than \u20ac130bn, which Angela Merkel\u2019s government hope will help the economy return to growth. The German economy contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter and the government is desperate to mitigate the effects of the pandemic as much as possible, especially in the run-up to elections in the autumn of 2021. Finance minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, told public broadcaster ZDF the measures could cost up to \u20ac10bn next year. \u201cThe goal now is to stabilise the economy,\u201d said Scholz. \u201cThe fact that we acted fast and big has resulted in Germany weathering the crisis much better than other (countries).\u201d The parties also agreed to prolong measures aimed at staving off bankruptcies by allowing firms in financial trouble due to the pandemic to delay filing for insolvency until the end of the year.

Heavily reliant on foreign tourism, the Indian Ocean archipelago lifted a lockdown in the capital in June and opened up its borders for tourists in July. Since the end of the lockdown in June, the number of Covid-19 cases in the Maldives has tripled, while deaths have risen from five to 28. The Maldives Health Protection Agency has confirmed a total of 7,047 Covid-19 cases in the country, out of which 2,580 cases are active. Just over 5,000 tourists visited the Maldives in the month to 15 August, according to Maldives Immigration, a fraction of last year\u2019s monthly average of more than 100,000.

Updated at 7.29am BST     6.26am BST       This is a fascinating piece from Associated Press. With winter ending in the southern hemisphere \u2013 ergo soon to begin in the north - it has emerged that measures to counter Covid-19 have dramatically slowed the spread of influenza. But that success is not guaranteed for countries about to enter their colder months. (PS I can confirm winter is ending in the southern hemisphere. Gloriously sunny out my window in Sydney, but here am I, inside still \u2026) Winter is ending in the southern hemisphere and country after country \u2013 South Africa, Australia, Argentina \u2013 have had a surprise: their steps against Covid-19 also apparently blocked the flu. But there\u2019s no guarantee the northern hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages. \u201cThis could be one of the worst seasons we\u2019ve had from a public health perspective with Covid and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we\u2019ve had,\u201d Dr Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. US health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this autumn, so hospitals aren\u2019t overwhelmed with a \u201cduelling twindemic\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are not specific for Covid. They\u2019re going to work for any respiratory virus,\u201d Redfield said.    The evidence: ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the southern hemisphere\u2019s winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country\u2019s National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none: something unprecedented. School closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have knocked down the flu, said Dr Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute\u2019s respiratory programme. \u201cThat not only meant lives saved from flu\u2019s annual toll, but it freed up our hospitals capacity to treat Covid-19 patients,\u201d Cohen added. In Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year. The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing, said Dr Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney. The coronavirus is blamed for about 24m infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world\u2019s hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the Covid-19 crush. Back in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the southern hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations. \u201cWe gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,\u201d said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb. Some countries\u2019 lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if Covid-19 still was on the rise? \u201cClearly the vigilance required to be successful against Covid is really high,\u201d said CDC\u2019s Redfield. \u201cThis virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s in part because 40% of people with Covid-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection,\u201d he said.    Flu hasn\u2019t disappeared, a World Health Organization report cautioned earlier this month. While globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year, it found sporadic cases are being reported. Plus, some people who had the flu in southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added. But international influenza experts say keeping schools closed children typically drive flu\u2019s spread and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped. \u201cWe don\u2019t have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they\u2019re doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,\u201d said Richard Webby of St Jude Children\u2019s Research hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution. In contrast, the US and Europe didn\u2019t impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their southern neighbours and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as Covid-19 still is being transmitted and the cooler months that favour influenza\u2019s spread are fast approaching. So the US CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield\u2019s goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated, usually only about half are. The US expects more than 190m doses of flu vaccine, about 20m more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds. In an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students from elementary to college this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine. In the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is likewise urging widespread flu vaccination. The flu vaccine only protects against influenza: it will not lessen the chances of contracting the coronavirus. Vaccines against Covid-19 are still being trialled. But for coronavirus protection, Redfield urges vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands. Countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the northern hemisphere heeds their lessons learned. \u201cIt could be very scary we honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert, said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble.\u201d    Updated at 6.46am BST     6.02am BST    India records 60,000-plus cases for eighth day running    India\u2019s rampant Covid-19 outbreak continues to spread across the country. The country recorded more than 60,000 cases the novel coronavirus for the eighth day in a row on Wednesday, as total cases crossed 3.2 million, data from the federal health ministry shows. The world\u2019s second-most populous country is third behind the United States and Brazil in terms of total caseload, and has recorded the world\u2019s highest single-day caseload consistently since earlier this month. Deaths in the last 24 hours stood at 1,059, taking the total number of fatalities from the infection to 59,449.

MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1% after hitting its highest since mid-2018 on Tuesday. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was off 0.1%. In Sydney, the ASX200 was down 0.9% and the Kospi in Seoul was off 0.25%. Shanghai has lost 1.1% and Hong Kong is in the red by 0.15%. Tai Hui, JP Morgan Asset M anagement\u2019s chief market strategist in Asia, identified the lack of refent central bank announcements as a possible reason why markets had stalled, a point that highlights the extent to which intervention has been responsible for the soaring markets.  If you look at the macro numbers, a lot of the improvement in Q2 seems to be slowing down in momentum. Central banks and governments are not really announcing anything new, and so markets are in a bit of a sideways move at this point in time.        5.22am BST       As the world scrambles to create a vaccine for Covid-19, a reminder of what vaccines can do.

Rates of transmission are easing in many parts of the world, the World Health Organisation has suggested. Governments have been ramping up efforts to contain the disease, which has claimed the lives of almost 814,000 people and infected at least 23 million since late last year. WHO data said fatality and infection rates were easing in most regions, notably in the hard-hit Americas, except Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. Residents in the capital of Xinjiang are being forced to take traditional Chinese medicine, being handcuffed to buildings and ordered to stay inside for weeks as part of a harsh range of measures to tackle coronavirus, according to posts online. Urumqi, the capital of the semi-autonomous region known for its draconian security measures, has been in a \u201cwartime state\u201d of lockdown for more than a month after a cluster of cases emerged in July, when the outbreak had been mostly contained elsewhere in China. South Korea has ordered doctors in Seoul to return to work on Wednesday as they began a three-day strike in protest against several government proposals, including one to boost the number of doctors to deal with health crises like the coronavirus. Trainee doctors have been staging ongoing walkouts, and thousands of additional doctors were due to stage a three-day strike starting on Wednesday. South Korea is battling one of its worst outbreaks of the coronavirus, with 320 new cases reported in the 24 hours to midnight Tuesday. UK prime minister Boris Johnson drops advice against face mask use in English schools. Pupils in England will no longer be advised against using face masks in schools after prime minister Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn days before students head back to the classroom. The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling. About 43,000 new cases are being reported daily across the country, down 21% from early August, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Experts credit the development at least partly to increased wearing of masks, even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day. Turkey recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June. Another 1,502 infections were confirmed on Tuesday, according to government data, taking the official tally over 261,000. India reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day. Infections rocketed by another 1.5 million since the start of August, taking India\u2019s total to around 3.1 million, more than in the US and Brazil. The rate of new cases in the country is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry. Gaza entered a 48-hour lockdown after the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the general population. Four cases of coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing over from Egypt and Israel. Health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak. Two European patients were confirmed to have been reinfected with coronavirus, raising concerns about immunity. Regional public broadcasters said a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been reinfected. It follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been reinfected four and a half months after recovering. The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter, the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970.

In a fresh round of stimulus, prime minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday promised greater spending on defence in a bid to grow the country\u2019s military and support 4,000 jobs. \u201cToday is again about the JobMaker plan, doing everything we can as we grow out of the Covid-19 recession to ensure that we keep Australians in jobs, and we keep businesses in business,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra.    While Australia has reported far fewer cases of COVID-19 compared to other developed countries, restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the virus have had a devastating impact on the country\u2019s economy, which will slip into a recession for the first time in three decades. Australia has so far promised to spend about A$260 billion in stimulus to support its ailing economy. The additional defence spending will also assist Australia with its commitment to grow defence spending to more than 2% of GDP, a key demand of US President Donald Trump who has accused allies of not pulling their weight.    Updated at 10.16am BST     4.56am BST       We mentioned earlier that in Germany, the government has extended for a further year a scheme to top up the pay of workers who have lost hours. New figures are now out on the country\u2019s Covid infections: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,576 to 236,429, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by three to 9,280, the tally showed.       4.34am BST       Residents in the capital of Xinjiang are being forced to take traditional Chinese medicine, being handcuffed to buildings and ordered to stay inside for weeks as part of a harsh range of measures to tackle coronavirus, according to posts online.

Since Friday, internet users have flooded social media platforms with complaints about overly harsh measures and extended quarantine at home or in designated locations, even as cases have gone down. The city, which had documented more than 531 cases by mid-August, has not reported any new cases in eight consecutive days.

While, by and large, the eight states and territories have co-operated well to combat the pandemic, border closures between states are now causing significant tensions. Before this year, the last time Australia\u2019s states and territories shut their borders to each other was during the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919 and 1920. The situation is particularly acute on the border between the country\u2019s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria. Much of that border is the Murray River, and riverine communities spanning the border have been effectively cut in half, keeping children from schools, employees from their workplaces, and perhaps most critically, doctors and nurses from hospitals.   Related: Regional health services under threat as Australian border closures cut off staff         4.04am BST       We\u2019ve spoken a great deal today about potential vaccines undergoing trials around the world. The trials at Oxford University are considered, perhaps, the furthest progressed in the world. And there is hope - all is hope at this stage - that there might be something definitive by the end of the year. Health editor Sarah Boseley reports: Trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine may have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year \u2013 but it will then need to go through the regulatory process, scientists say. Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it is \u201cjust possible\u201d that there may be enough clinical trial data on Oxford University\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine to put before the regulators this year. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has said a vaccine may not be ready until next winter. Pollard suggested they were hoping to go faster. \u201cI think that Chris Whitty is quite rightly being cautious, that it could take as long as that to first of all demonstrate a vaccine works and is safe and then to go through the processes of regulators looking at that very carefully to make sure everything\u2019s been done correctly,\u201d Pollard told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.

Trainee doctors have been staging ongoing walkouts, and thousands of additional doctors were due to stage a three-day strike starting on Wednesday. The strikes come as South Korea battles one of its worst outbreaks of the coronavirus, with 320 new cases reported in the 24 hours to midnight Tuesday, the latest in more than a week and a half of triple-digit increases. The walkouts on Wednesday forced South Korea\u2019s five major general hospitals to limit their hours and delay scheduled surgeries, Yonhap news agency reported. Earlier in the week, the doctors reached an agreement with the government to continue to handle coronavirus patients, but failed to find a compromise on the broader issues. \u201cThe government now has no choice but to take necessary legal actions such as an order to open business to not put the citizens\u2019 lives and safety in danger,\u201d health minister Park Neung-hoo said in a briefing. \u201cWe urge all trainee and fellow doctors to immediately return to work.\u201d    He said the Korean Medical Association (KMA) and the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) had rejected several of the government\u2019s offers. In a statement, KMA said the medical community was always open to all possibilities in talks with the government, and that the doctors did not want to have to strike. \u201cWe sincerely do want to return,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe ask you citizens to listen to our voice so that we can meet our patients as soon as possible.\u201d KMA and KIRA members have said they oppose government plans to boost the number of medical students over several years, establish public medical schools, allow government insurance to cover more oriental medicine, and introduce more telemedicine options. The government said its goal to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 over the next 10 years is necessary to better prepare for public health crises like the coronavirus pandemic. Student doctors, however, said the plan would unnecessarily flood an already competitive market, and that the extra funding would be better spent improving the salaries of existing trainees, which would encourage them to move out of Seoul to rural areas where more health professionals are needed.     Updated at 6.16am BST     2.55am BST       A German scheme that tops up pay for workers who lost work hours because of the coronavirus pandemic has been extended by another year to stave off mass job losses. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition of conservatives and centre-left Social Democrats agreed on Tuesday to allow the programme to run for 24 months for any firm that applies by the end of the year. It also resolved to extend financial assistance to small businesses until the end of the year and relax insolvency laws in an effort to avoid cascading bankruptcies. The shorter-hours programme, known as Kurzarbeit, sees the German government cover around two-thirds of workers\u2019 wages when employers slash their hours to save costs. The scheme was widely used during the 2008-09 financial crisis and credited with saving tens of thousands of jobs. The programme is one of the main tools used by Berlin to shield Europe\u2019s top economy from the pandemic-induced downturn, accounting for a key part of the government\u2019s trillion-euro (US$1.1 trillion) coronavirus support package. At the height of the coronavirus lockdowns in April, some 6.8m Germans received money through the scheme, the federal employment agency said. To ease access to the programme, ministers reduced the requirements that companies need to meet in order to qualify for assistance. German giants like Lufthansa, Volkswagen and BMW are among the many firms to have tapped into the scheme.    Before the pandemic, German unemployment hovered at a record-low level of around five percent. It has since risen to 6.4 percent. And after years of balanced budgets, the German government has said it plans to borrow around 218 billion euros this year to help pay for its pandemic response. Other European economies, including France and Britain, introduced similar short-time working programmes to battle the economic consequences of the pandemic.

Contact tracing is now underway for anyone who attended weddings or services at the church. The minister of health Chris Hipkins said the government had distributed 3 million masks to low socio-economic areas ahead of them becoming mandatory on public transport at midnight Sunday.

The COVAX AMC is designed to secure Covid-19 vaccines - when one exists - for all countries, not just those that can afford to purchase or manufacture vaccines themselves. Australia is contributing AU$80m (US$57m) the country\u2019s foreign minister Marise Payne announced. The AMC is designed to address the acute phase of the pandemic, providing doses for up to 20 percent of countries\u2019 populations in its first phase, ensuring that health care workers and vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, have access. Pacific countries eligible for COVAX AMC support include Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Kiribati. Eligible countries from Southeast Asia are Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, The Philippines and Vietnam. Chair of the Pacific Friends of Global Health Board, Professor Brendan Crabb, said a global vehicle designed to ensure that the poorest don\u2019t miss out on access to a Covid vaccine was vital.  Vaccines are not magic force shields for individuals, none of us are safe until everyone\u2019s safe. In that way, vaccinating all those in our region is essential, not just to protect those in need who deserve rich country support but it is also in our own enlightened self interest. It is important also to note that in low-income settings, Covid-19 is likely to cause far more suffering from other diseases than from Covid-19 itself. Health systems just can\u2019t can\u2019t cope. We know that deaths from malaria, TB and HIV have already been increasing due to the diversion of testing and workforce attention to Covid-19 in countries such as PNG.  There is currently no vaccine for Covid-19.

Oxford, too, is conducting human trials of its potential vaccine. In Australia, the University of Queensland has begun early trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine on hamsters, yielding \u201cpositive indications\u201d about its possible effectiveness in humans. The findings from the pre-clinical trials have been reported to the International Society for Vaccines by project co-leader and UQ Associate Professor Keith Chappell. \u201cThe neutralising immune response created by our molecular clamp vaccine in animal models was better than the average level of antibodies found in patients who have recovered from Covid-19,\u201d Chappell said in a statement on Wednesday. In the hamsters trial, the potential vaccine \u2013 when combined with MF59 technology developed by Seqirus, a unit of Australian biotechnology group CSL \u2013 provided protection against virus replication and reduced lung inflammation following exposure to the virus. \u201cIt also induces a strong T-cell response and showed strong results when it came to data relating to manufacturability,\u201d Chappell said.       1.09am BST       While the World Health Organisation says Covid transmission rates are easing across much of the world, they are continuing to escalate in places like India - 18 straight record days of infections, more than 67,000 new cases in the past 24 hours - and southeast Asia.

An enlarged meeting of the politburo of the Workers Party took place amid a pandemic that is putting additional pressure on the North Korean economy, battered by recent border closures and flood damage. The meeting assessed \u201csome defects in the state emergency anti-epidemic work for checking the inroads of the malignant virus\u201d, KCNA said in a statement.    North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but Kim said last month that the virus \u201ccould be said to have entered\u201d the country and imposed a lockdown after a man was reported to have symptoms. Later test results on the man were inconclusive, according to the World Health Organisation. Kim had this month lifted a three-week lockdown in the city of Kaesong after a suspected case of the coronavirus there. The meeting discussed state emergency measures on preventing crop damage and casualties from Typhoon Bavi, which is expected to hit the country within days, KCNA reported. Heavy rain and flooding have raised concern about food supplies in the isolated country.    The ruling party had said it will hold a congress next year to decide a new five-year plan, after a party meeting noted serious delays in improving the national economy and living standards.       12.28am BST       The University of Cambridge is aiming to start clinical trials of its possible coronavirus vaccine in the autumn after it received \u00a31.9m (US$2.5m) in funding from the British government, the university said on Wednesday. The scientists behind the vaccine said their approach, which uses genetic sequences of all known coronaviruses to hone the immune response, could help avoid the adverse effects of a hyper-inflammatory immune response. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for chinks in its armour, crucial pieces of the virus that we can use to construct the vaccine to direct the immune response in the right direction,\u201d Jonathan Heeney, head of the Laboratory of Viral Zoonotics at the University of Cambridge, said. \u201cUltimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from SARS-CoV-2, but also other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans.\u201d No vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has yet been proven clinically effective, though 30 that use a range of technologies are in human trials already. The Cambridge candidate, DIOS-CoVax2, is DNA based. Computer-generated antigen structures are encoded by synthetic genes, which can then re-programme the body\u2019s immune system to produce antibodies against the coronavirus. \u201cThis could be a major breakthrough in being able to give a future vaccine to huge numbers of people across the world,\u201d said Saul Faust, Director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility.    This DNA vector method has been shown to be safe and effective at stimulating an immune response in other pathogens in early stage trials, the university said. Although it is operating at a later timetable than some other vaccine candidates, the DIOS-CoVax2 shot would not need to be stored at cold temperatures and could be delivered without needles, possibly making the widespread distribution of the vaccine easier.    Updated at 12.29am BST     12.14am BST       Sweden\u2019s Public Health Agency says a faulty test kit had returned some 3,700 false positive results, an error discovered by two laboratories during routine quality controls. On Tuesday, the agency said the PCR kits, which test for an ongoing Covid-19 infection, were made in China by the company BGI Genomics and had been distributed worldwide. In Sweden, the kits were used by people conducting at-home tests between period March and August, the agency said. Mostly, \u201cpeople who had mild symptoms or who didn\u2019t feel any symptoms at the time of the test received false positive results,\u201d the agency said in a statement.    It added that it would contact those affected this week, as well as adjusting Sweden\u2019s official number of cases. \u201cThe faulty test kit has been reported to the Swedish Medical Products Agency. It has been exported by China to many other countries,\u201d the agency said, adding that it has \u201cinformed relevant authorities in Europe and the WHO\u201d. Sweden on Tuesday said it had 86,891 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 5,814 deaths.       12.01am BST    Transmission easing in many parts of the world, says WHO    The World Health Organisation has suggested the pace of Covid-19 transmission is easing in many parts of the world. Governments have been ramping up efforts to contain the disease, which has claimed the lives of almost 814,000 people and infected at least 23 million since late last year. WHO data said fatality and infection rates were easing in most regions, notably in the hard-hit Americas, except Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. In Africa, WHO regional director Matshidiso Moeti said new cases were declining after the continent passed \u201cwhat seems to have been a peak\u201d. But Health Minister Zweli Mkhize of hard-hit South Africa warned that \u201cour biggest worry is whether in fact this is the first surge and there might be another one\u201d, pointing to the latest developments in Spain. One of the worst affected countries in Europe, Spain is to use 2,000 soldiers trained in tracking to help regions identify those who have been exposed to infected people. \u201cWe can\u2019t let the pandemic once again take control of our lives... we must take control and halt this second curve,\u201d prime minister Pedro Sanchez said.    Although fatality rates have been falling, the WHO said it recorded more than 1.7 million new coronavirus cases and some 39,000 new deaths in the week to August 23. That represented however a five-percent decrease in new cases globally and a 12-percent drop in new deaths compared with the week before.       11.55pm BST       Good morning/afternoon/evening, wherever these words find you.

A summary of recent developments:  UK prime minister Boris Johnson drops advice against face mask use in English schools. Pupils in England will no longer be advised against using face masks in schools after prime minister Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn days before students head back to the classroom. The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling. About 43,000 new cases are being reported daily across the country, down 21% from early August, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Experts credit the development at least partly to increased wearing of masks, even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day. Turkey recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June. Another 1,502 infections were confirmed on Tuesday, according to government data, taking the official tally over 261,000. India reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day. Infections rocketed by another 1.5 million since the start of August, taking India\u2019s total to around 3.1 million, more than in the US and Brazil. The rate of new cases in the country is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry. Gaza entered a 48-hour lockdown after the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the general population. Four cases of coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing over from Egypt and Israel. Health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak. Two European patients were confirmed to have been reinfected with coronavirus, raising concerns about immunity. Regional public broadcasters said a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been reinfected. It follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been reinfected four and a half months after recovering. The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter, the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970. The statistics office said it came as consumer spending (10.9% down), company investments (19.6% down) and exports (20.3% down) all collapsed at the height of the pandemic.     ", "Concerns raised over Australian universities' plan to use exam-monitoring software [2020-04-20T06:54:08Z]": "Australian universities have sparked privacy concerns over plans to use software to monitor students through webcams as they take exams from home during the coronavirus pandemic. Students, academics and privacy experts have criticised the decision, from multiple universities, to sign up to remote exam monitoring software created by third-party companies. The Australian National University in Canberra told Guardian Australia it has signed an agreement to use the US-owned Proctorio software, while the University of Queensland and University of Sydney will use ProctorU \u2013 also developed by a US-based company. The University of Canberra told Guardian Australia it was exploring a number of providers including Proctorio. Both platforms require students to potentially grant access to their computer\u2019s webcam, microphone and keystrokes to prevent cheating.   Related: 'We feel abandoned': international students in Australia facing coronavirus alone    Both platforms also use artificial intelligence, including machine learning and facial detection technology, to verify students\u2019 identities and spot suspicious activity during exams. Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition from ANU students opposing the use of Proctorio, and Dr Monique Mann, the chair of the surveillance committee at the Australian Privacy Foundation, said she was concerned by the platforms\u2019 description of artificial intelligence. She said all universities should prepare privacy assessments of their software and submit them to their state or territory privacy commissioner before they are used for students. \u201cI would certainly want to know what information they are collecting about my students, how are they making inferences on the behaviour of my students, how long is it being retained, and what other purposes is it being used for,\u201d she said.  A spokesperson for Proctorio said: \u201cProctorio allows approved administrators and instructors to set this information with our customisable settings, meaning these individuals are fully aware of the information collected. Proctorio also clearly presents their test-takers with this information before each and every exam. \u201cUnlike our competitors who collect biometric data, Proctorio never collects anything additional than what the institution has already collected from the student (via single sign-on).\u201cWhen an instructor is setting up their exam, they can select from different settings and adjust the severity of each.\u201d Richard Prangell, a board member at Electronic Frontiers Australia, said students should not be expected to install monitoring software on their own computers for the benefit of their university. \u201cKeystrokes, screenshots, audio and video can capture all kinds of private, and often unintended information about a student and perhaps even other members of their household.\u201d  At the ANU, students from 13 faculty clubs and societies have written an open letter to the university opposing the software. Sasha Personeni and Ronan Skyring, two ANU students and reporters for student newspaper Woroni, said students had also raised the concern that the automated system would flag \u201cregular nervous movement\u201d as cheating.   Related: 'A downward spiral': coronavirus spins Australian universities into economic crisis    \u201cThe software fundamentally works by using AI in real time to analyse the use of a laptop by a student,\u201d Personeni said. \u201cIt analyses your movement in comparison to everyone else\u2019s. If you are the only student to look at a clock, and no other student does, you are automatically flagged as suspicious. \u201cThat is not reliable enough, in my opinion, to warrant students being potentially investigated. It\u2019s pretty common for a lot of students, myself included, when we sit exams, to look around the room, take pauses, or fidget, while you consider the question.\u201d The Proctorio spokesperson said that \u201csubtle movements, such as the one implied, are not likely to be flagged\u201d. \u201cOur facial detection is used to identify students looking away from the exam frequently and for long intervals of time, to identify if there are multiple people in the testing environment or if the student leaves the testing environment.\u201d Skyring said that he and other students would prefer if remote exam software was being conducted by the ANU rather than a third party. \u201cIf we knew it was being conducted on Wattle, which is an ANU website, then we would know it would only be accessed by ANU staff, who have signed obligations to protect our privacy and more,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be OK with it if I had full transparency,\u201d Personeni said. \u201cWith actual information about where the data is being stored, who can access it, and whether it complies with the actual Australian regulations.\u201d Proctorio\u2019s spokesperson said its software \u201ccomplies with the strictest data privacy regulations, including Australian, German and European regulations\u201d. An ANU spokesman told Guardian Australia that \u201conly a small proportion\u201d of exams would use Proctorio, and the university would test the use of the platform in May and forward findings to students. The ANU has completed a privacy impact assessment for Proctorio that concluded that \u201cno personal information is sent to or held in the system\u201d and \u201cno third parties will have access to or be provided with the personal information.\u201d An ANU spokesman said Proctorio does \u201cnot record every keystroke or mouse movement\u201d and cannot access the files on a student\u2019s personal computer. The university said any student could opt out of the system and apply for a deferred exam to be taken when face-to-face exams are allowed, and that students with accessibility arrangements would be supported. But Mann said that as a teaching academic, she believed universities and academics should redesign assessments to make them harder to cheat in, rather than use \u201cpunitive surveillance technology\u201d. Skyring said deferring exams was not a reasonable way to allow students to opt-out of the software. \u201cThere are people who are doing subjects this semester who may not be able to do an exam until next year\u201d, he said. \u201cHaving to do an exam six to 12 months after you have studied a subject is unfeasible.\u201d The University of Queensland\u2019s student union have called on their university to abandon plans to use ProctorU. In a statement, UQ said only \u201cauthorised UQ staff\u201d would have access to the data collected by the program. \u2022 This story was amended on 28 April 2020 to make clear that Proctorio does not require students to upload their biometric data, and to add further context to other concerns expressed about its programs.", "Another Australian politician tests positive and AFL season reduced \u2013 as it happened [2020-03-16T11:39:10Z]": " \n  9.11pm GMT  \n  \n  This liveblog is now closed.

I think it\u2019s fair to say that the big take aways were around the government\u2019s response, and the information (or lack thereof) being provided by the government.Bill Bowtell: \n   \n   \u201cYou\u2019ve had, since the beginning of January to do this. And when the situation got serious in Taiwan, they created a national unified command I think on January 20. Eight weeks ago. \n   \u201cNothing like that was done here. There was no public education campaign. There was no mobilisation of the people. The state governments did not sanitise and disinfect the transport systems.

Everybody go out and it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.36am GMT  \n  \n  Should we try for herd immunity? \n  Bowtell says there is no immunity yet. \n  \u201cWell, it\u2019s extremely controversial because it assumes, it makes a set of assumptions that are not scientifically evident. Coronavirus is a novel new infection. Nobody\u2019s immune to it. There is no immunity like there is to influenza.\u201d \n  He says it is \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d and questions whether Australia has adopted the herd immunity approach.Haikerwal says herd immunity is a \u201ccop-out\u201d and a decision will ultimately need to be made on whether to keep schools open. \n  \n \n \n  11.30am GMT  \n  \n  A mother of a 10-year-old child with cystic fibrosis is concerned what the impact of coronavirus will have on her son, and whether he will still have access to the health services he needs.Colbeck says it is about reducing the impact on the healthcare system, and reducing the rate of infection. Mostyn says the government needs to open up the funding for the NDIS to make it easier for parents to get payments with the money that is available.She suggests casual workers put out of work could be trained up quickly to cope with the surge in demand for other services such as that in the NDIS. \n  \n \n \n  11.24am GMT  \n  \n  Take the politics out of it, Bowtell argues, like Bob Hawke and Andrew Peacock did during the Aids crisis in the 1980s:\u201cThe people who then ran the response to that were funded, were eminent experts from across the field of virology, epidemiology and public communication. There was no politicisisation, there was no political party brawling in the parliament. And it worked very well. We saved tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of thousands of unnecessary infections, unlike in the US for example. That was the model. \u201cWe used to be a leader in this field.\u201dHe says this response should have happened already. \n  \u201c[What we] are facing on the verge of a serious national calamity, with the fierce urgency of now, tonight, is to correct all the things that have not been done and to really take effective action to persuade the people to basically isolate themselves until we can figure out what is going on and what to do.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 11.32am GMT \n \n \n  11.16am GMT  \n  \n  Did the government launch advertising too late?It was only launched over the weekend. Colbeck argues there has been a consistent message, but Haikerwal says it should have been sooner, and a more consistent message about what people should be doing to protect themselves.Gallagher agreed: \n  \u201cIt\u2019s been too late, Hamish. And now the government is having to deal - everyone is having to deal with the level of anxiety and fear in the community that could have and should have been dealt with better by earlier access to information, so that you build trust.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have trust, then you\u2019ve got real problems.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  11.08am GMT  \n  \n  Asked what the government would do for casual workers put on leave, Colbeck says government won\u2019t be able to do it all on its own, and discussions were underway with industry, unions and workers.\u201cThis is going to be extremely difficult for us all...This will work across the entire economy. It will continue to evolve and we\u2019ll have to continue at looking at what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  11.03am GMT  \n  \n  Sam Mostyn tells the panel that there needs to be a single voice of authority. Colbeck argues that is the role of the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019ve had other voices that have split off from that process which I agree has confused the message,\u201d he said. \n  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. That\u2019s why Brendan Murphy has been there every day so that he can in the same way that we did during the fires, have somebody who has access to all the information that\u2019s required and can then be part of transmitting that to the Australian community.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  10.57am GMT  \n  \n  Bowtell tells Colbeck the government is not ahead of the curve, and hospitals will not be able to cope with the exponential growth in cases NSW forecast earlier today: \n   \n   \u201cYou\u2019ve had, since the beginning of January to do this.

Brisbane-based Corporate Travel Management, which is under siege by short-sellers, has plunged almost 18% and Flight Centre has fallen 13%. Sydney Airport stock has tumbled almost 16%. \n  But losses have been clawed back at Qantas, which is down just 1.26%. The other Australian-listed airline, Air New Zealand, is in a trading halt after announcing savage capacity cuts and job losses this morning. \n  \n Updated at 3.03am GMT \n \n \n  2.39am GMT  \n  \n  The Australian arts industry has called for an \u201cemergency support package\u201d after the new social distancing restrictions cancelled any event with more than 500 people.  \n  A swathe of concerts, festivals, shows and galleries have closed or been cancelled \u2013 including the entire Melbourne International Comedy Festival.  \n  Germany and the UK have already instituted similar packages, and the Australian arts industry raised millions of dollars in bushfire relief over the summer.  \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus: Australian arts industry calls for 'emergency support package'  \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.24am GMT  \n Second stimulus package will be prepared \n  \n  Most readers will know the Morrison government last week unveiled an economic stimulus package worth $17bn. It wasn\u2019t clear at the time that would be enough, and obviously events are now moving at a clip. The Reserve Bank this morning signalled it is preparing to move to quantitative easing.  \n  I gather the government has begun work today on a second package of measures. People are telling me round two will involve support for business and another round of stimulus for households. Cabinet (the regular one, not the special one, which is the rolling meeting of the prime minister and the premiers) is due to meet tomorrow. \n   \n   \n    The government is working up a second stimulus package #auspol #COVID\u30fc19\u2014 Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) March 16, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.21am GMT  \n  \n  Peter Dutton was \u201cnot infectious on the plane\u201d with coronavirus while returning from the US, Kelly says.  \n  \u201cI spoke to Mr Dutton in his hospital room on Friday night and I\u2019m not going to go into the details of his particular illness but I can say he was not infectious on the plane,\u201d the deputy chief medical officer said.  \n  \u201cWhether he caught it on the plane or before that it\u2019s hard to know. The incubation for this particular virus is quite long. It can be up to 14 days. He had been back in Australia for six days by the time he became sick.\u201d \n  However, earlier today, two women who sat near Dutton on the plane have tested positive for coronavirus. Last week, Kelly also advised the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that he did not need to be tested for the virus, as he had not met Dutton in person in the 24 hours before he developed symptoms.  \n  \n Updated at 2.25am GMT \n \n \n  2.12am GMT  \n  \n  Remote Indigenous communities and people in aged care \u201care front of mind\u201d in the government\u2019s response, Kelly says. He also broadens that out to say the focus is on anybody vulnerable.  \n  He says they are looking at measures to prevent infections in aged care homes, including some they already put in place during flu outbreaks. Restricting access to the homes is among some things \u201con the table\u201d, he says.  \n  In response to a question about how many ventilators Australia has, Kelly says he \u201cstresses again most people will not require a ventilator\u201d.  \n  \u201cEighty per cent of people will be mildly affected and won\u2019t even end up in hospital, let alone intensive care, let alone needing ventilation. That\u2019s very much the end of the spectrum. \n  \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the supply [of ventilators] and looking at what we can do to dampen the demand.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.16am GMT \n \n \n  2.05am GMT  \n  \n  The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, is speaking now in Canberra.  \n  He says that Australia now has nearly 300 cases of Covid-19 and, sadly, five deaths.  \n  He says \u201cthis week it\u2019s all about slowing the curve of the epidemic\u201d. He notes \u201c80% of the people who get sick with this disease develop a mild illness\u201d.  \n  But he warns that \u201cpeople over the age of 60 are more susceptible to this disease. And we are finding in the much older age groups 80 and above, the death rate is actually quite high.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.06am GMT \n \n \n  1.59am GMT  \n Explainer: what is quantitative easing? \n  \n  The Reserve Bank this morning announced it would begin so-called quantitative easing (QE) this week to support the economy amid the coronavirus crisis. It involves the central bank buying up government bonds and other financial assets from banks and pensions funds, thereby flooding the system with liquidity. The hope is that the financial institutions will use the extra funds to increase lending to households and businesses. \n  It\u2019s often referred to as a \u201cmoney printing scheme\u201d because although the money used to buy the bonds is electronic and not printed notes, those funds are nevertheless simply created by the central bank at the push of a button. \n  We don\u2019t know yet how much the RBA scheme will be worth but it will run into billions of dollars. When the Bank of England started the scheme in the GFC, it racked up \u00a3375bn (A$750bn) over three years before it stopped in late 2012. The US Fed reached US$4.5tn in its first five years. Japan\u2019s total is also in the trillions. \n  So what does it mean and how has this come about? \n  This is an extraordinary, radical measure used by central banks in the US, UK, Europe and Japan in the past decade to prop up the financial system in the wake of the global financial crisis. \n  Back then, the mechanics of the system seized up as billions of dollars worth of financial instruments were exposed as worthless and bank after bank collapsed. Central banks cut interest rates to flood the system with cheap money but when that failed to stem the crisis, notably when the mighty investment bank Lehman Brothers crashed, they got together and launched QE. \n  It was considered an emergency measure but despite attempts to wind back the scheme, especially by the US Fed, the schemes have underpinned western economies ever since. The massive amount of cheap money unleashed by the schemes has inflated asset bubbles all over the world, with stock markets reaching all-time highs as recently as February. Attempts to deflate the bubbles met with panic in the financial markets \u2013 notably the Fed taper tantrum fiasco. \n  This time around it\u2019s a different problem because the economy itself is seizing up as normal daily activity grinds to a halt across the world. But the response of central banks is the same because all of them \u2013 including the RBA \u2013 have already cut rates as far as they can in recent years and have no alternative except to unleash QE and hope that it reassures investors that they will prop up the system \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. \n   \n    Related: What is quantitative easing?  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.12am GMT \n \n \n  1.50am GMT  \n  \n  The National Gallery of Australia, in Canberra, will suspend tours, school visits, events and talks \u2013 but will remain open.  \n  In an email to members, the gallery said that the suspension would last at least four weeks.  \n  \n Updated at 1.53am GMT \n \n \n  1.43am GMT  \n  \n  Bluesfest, a NSW music festival due to host Patti Smith, Crowded House and Dave Matthews Band, has been cancelled today.

The Guardian apologises for the error.  \n  \n \n \n  1.23am GMT  \n  \n  The former prime minister Kevin Rudd has written for the Guardian offering some advice on how the government should be responding to the coronavirus. He is not flattering of the response:  \n   \n   If the battle cry of our government\u2019s response to the Global Financial Crisis was \u201cgo early, go hard, go households,\u201d this government\u2019s approach to the current crisis seems to be \u201cgo late, go half-measures, and go... well...go to Hillsong\u201d. \n   For a decade we have been accused of having gone too far in our efforts to avoid the GFC. When we look back on the decisions taken over the last month, they will be seen (as with the bushfires) as the mark of a complacent and negligent government. \n   \n  His conclusion about the response so far?  \n   \n   Like their response to the public health challenge: too little, too late. \n   \n  You can read the full column here \n  \n \n \n  1.18am GMT  \n ASX claws back some early losses \n  \n  The Australian sharemarket had clawed some losses by midday after diving 7% at the opening bell, with the benchmark ASX200 index down 5.3% from Friday\u2019s closing price. \n  In reactions to the coronavirus crisis this morning, Air New Zealand has cut 85% of its international flights and will cut jobs, Crown Resorts has closed every second poker machine at its casinos and the hearing implant company Cochlear has withdrawn its previous profit forecasts. \n  But the big development is that financial regulators are going to meet with the big banks this week. The immediate problem is that small to medium businesses have no money to repay their loans. Banks have said they will allow those customers to delay repayments, which in turn will put pressure on their own businesses. \n  If small businesses start sacking people in droves, defaults on home mortgages become more likely. This is a potentially big problem for the banks, which have lent heavily against houses.  \n  \n Updated at 1.29am GMT \n \n \n  1.13am GMT  \n Reserve Bank says it is prepared to start quantitative easing \n  \n  The Reserve Bank of Australia has confirmed it \u201cstands ready\u201d to purchase Australian government bonds \u2013 that is \u2013 it is prepared to use quantitative easing to boost the economy, a move it flagged in November.  \n  A full announcement will be made on Thursday, but in the meantime, the RBA governor, Phil Lowe, said in a statement: \n   \n   As Australia\u2019s financial system adjusts to the coronavirus (Covid-19), financial regulators and the Australian Government are working closely together to help ensure that Australia\u2019s financial markets continue to operate effectively and that credit is available to households and businesses. Refer to earlier CFR press release. Australia\u2019s financial system is resilient and it is well placed to deal with the effects of the coronavirus. At the same time, trading liquidity has deteriorated in some markets. \n   \n   \n   In response, the Reserve Bank stands ready to purchase Australian government bonds in the secondary market to support the smooth functioning of that market, which is a key pricing benchmark for the Australian financial system. The bank will also be conducting one-month and three-month repo operations in its daily market operations until further notice to provide liquidity to Australian financial markets. In addition the bank will conduct longer term repo operations of six-months maturity or longer at least weekly, as long as market conditions warrant. The Reserve Bank and the AOFM are in close liaison in monitoring market conditions and supporting continued functioning of the market. \n   \n   \n   The bank will announce further policy measures to support the Australian economy on Thursday. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.48am GMT \n \n \n  1.11am GMT  \n  \n  Domestic violence service providers say the sector needs more support to deal with the effects of coronavirus. \n  The Australian Women Against Violence Alliance has warned of a possible spike in domestic violence cases if people are forced to self-isolate at home, AAP report.  \n  The program manager, Dr Merrindahl Andrew, said China had experienced an increase in domestic violence rates as people were forced to stay indoors. \n  Andrew pointed to the Brisbane murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children \u2013 Laianah, Aaliyah and Trey \u2013 by her ex-partner, Rowan Baxter. \n  \u201cThe services are already experiencing spikes in demand because of that,\u201d she told AAP. \u201cThe underlying level of resourcing for services is already too low so when there are crises overlapping then we can expect that there\u2019ll be even more problems.\u201d \n  Andrew said she was disappointed that a meeting of federal, state and territory leaders on Friday had not delivered any more support for the sector. \n  Likewise, Domestic Violence Victoria\u2019s acting chief executive, Alison Macdonald, said enforced isolation could lead to a rise in domestic violence cases.  \n  Macdonald said she would be looking to have a domestic violence sector briefing with Victorian authorities this week. \n  \n Updated at 1.26am GMT \n \n \n  1.05am GMT  \n  \n  The Sydney chicken chain Chargrill Charlies is banning dining in, and is implementing cashless payments only.  \n  The roast chicken purveyor will now be takeaway only, and will close shops in the middle of the day for cleaning.  \n   \n   \n    Can imagine other chains might do similar soon - Chargrill Charlie\u2019s is only doing cashless payments, going takeaway only, closing dine-in options, and closing shops for 1.5 hours a day for cleaning pic.twitter.com/02V0ICT6e7\u2014 Josh Butler (@JoshButler) March 16, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.27am GMT \n \n \n  1.00am GMT  \n  \n  More on the upcoming 28 March Queensland local elections.  \n  The electoral commission says they will go ahead with extra hygiene precautions, report AAP.  \n  \u201cWe recognise that this is an extraordinary situation and are adapting our service model accordingly,\u201d said the electoral commissioner, Pat Vidgen. \n  \n Updated at 1.25am GMT \n \n \n  12.55am GMT  \n  \n  Labor is targeting Australian Border Force for refusing to provide paid sick leave to casual workers.

In an email to staff it said:  \n   \n   While the department acknowledges your request to provide paid miscellaneous leave to casual employees, it is not appropriate to do so given the nature of their employment. While we appreciate the efforts and commitment that casual employees are displaying, the nature of their employment is clear and the department is not in a position to afford them a paid leave entitlement. \n   \n  The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said: \u201cCoronavirus can\u2019t tell the difference between a casual or a full-time worker and casual ABF officers should have access to the same coronavirus sick leave as their full-time counterparts \u2013 it\u2019s that simple. \n  \u201cPeter Dutton is asking his ABF officers to protect Australians from coronavirus \u2013 the least he can do is help protect them, their families and their pay packets.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 1.24am GMT \n \n \n  12.46am GMT  \n  \n  ABC News Breakfast will no longer allow guests into the studio \u2013 from now on it will all be via video-link. \n   \n   \n    Life is changing for all Australians, including all of us here at @BreakfastNews.

Thanks again ....love to all RW xx\u2014 Richard Wilkins (@RichardWilkins) March 15, 2020\n    \n   \n  A Nine spokesperson said Wilkins \u201cis not showing any symptoms of the virus and has been self-isolating, on his own at home, since Thursday last week\u201d.  \n  \n Updated at 11.10pm GMT \n \n \n  10.47pm GMT  \n  \n  The corporate regulator has told high-volume stock market traders to reduce the number of orders they place by up to a quarter after last week\u2019s market chaos.There were \u201cexponential increases in the number of trades executed, with a particularly large increase in trades last Friday, 13 March\u201d, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said.\u201cIf the number of trades executed continues to increase, it will put strain on the processing and risk management capabilities of market infrastructure and market participants,\u201d Asic said.\u201cAccordingly, Asic has issued directions under the Asic Market Integrity Rules to a number of large equity market participants ... These directions require those firms to reduce their number of executed trades [a day] by up to 25% from the levels executed on Friday.\u201d \n  The Australian market, which has been falling since 20 February, plunged as much as 8% on Friday before rallying strongly to finish the day up more than 4% \u2013 a turnaround unprecedented in living memory. \n  Asic\u2019s direction comes after the US Federal Reserve slashed official rates to effectively zero overnight. The New Zealand central bank has also made a surprise move to cut rates by 0.75%, to 0.25%. \n  Pressure is now building on the Australian Reserve Bank to make an out-of-cycle cut and bring rates to 0.25%, which the bank has previously said is effectively zero.  \n  Central banks, including the RBA, have also been spending up in debt markets in an effort to stop the flow of credit freezing over, as happened in the run-up to the global financial crisis. \n  \n Updated at 10.57pm GMT \n \n \n  10.41pm GMT  \n  \n  And meanwhile, while in self-isolation in Queensland, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have impressed Australians with a courageously thick spread of Vegemite on their Sunday morning toast. \n   \n   \n    Thanks to the Helpers.

We will be constructive. We will support the government to protect the health of Australians, but also to protect their jobs and our economy. \n   \n  Albanese\u2019s focus was things the government should be doing better, including: \n   \n   More consistent advice \u2013 such as when to self-isolate and when to get tested \n   Getting more people tested more quickly \n   The fast tracking of fever clinics \n   Expanding Medicare to allow people to call or Skype their GP \n   A serious reduction in large gatherings of people \n   Timely and comprehensive travel advice and restrictions that are updated more frequently \n   \n  \u201cThere is now no room for delays,\u201d he said.  \n  You can watch the full address here. \n  \n Updated at 10.56pm GMT \n \n \n  10.27pm GMT  \n  \n  Melbourne\u2019s public libraries and recreation centres will be closed temporarily, the City of Melbourne has announced.  \n  \u201cOur six libraries and four recreation centres will close from 2pm today until Tuesday 31 March 2020, with the possibility of this closure being extended,\u201d the council said. \n  The following libraries, arts centres and recreation centres will be closed:  \n   \n   City Library in Flinders Lane, Kathleen Syme in Carlton, Library at The Dock in Docklands, East Melbourne, North Melbourne and Southbank Library at Boyd. \n   Melbourne City Baths, Kensington Recreation Centre, Carlton Baths and North Melbourne Recreation Centre. \n   Meat Market, Signal, ArtPlay and Arts House.

That will be from 7am to 8am, starting tomorrow, at most (but not all) stores.  \n  From AAP:  \n  Access will be granted if the shopper has a relevant government issued concession card. All other shoppers will be granted access after 8am. \n  Meanwhile, the small national supermarket chain IGA is considering whether to roll out a pensioners-and-seniors-only shopping hour across its 1,300 Australian stores. \n  The idea is being trialled at an IGA in Melbourne\u2019s Altona, with a shopping hour between 6am to 7am. \n  \u201cI would think that we could make a decision as a network in the next 24-48 hours,\u201d IGA\u2019s chief executive, Fred Harrison, told Nine. \n  \n Updated at 10.22pm GMT \n \n \n  9.58pm GMT  \n  \n  More detail on those fines for organisers of events with more than 500 people.  \n  In NSW the health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced that today he had made an order under section section of the Public Health Act 2010 that will \u201cforce the immediate cancellation of public events with more than 500 people\u201d. \n  \u201cIndividuals who fail to comply could face up to six months in prison or a fine of up to $11,000 or both, plus additional penalties for each day the offence continues.

That needs to be done sensitively ... We need to lessen the broader risk for people in these facilities.\u201d \n  Morrison confirmed that the widespread closure of schools was not recommended, although \u201cspecific instances\u201d of outbreaks in specific schools had attracted closures in NSW and Victoria. He said the government made decisions based on \u201cfacts not opinions\u201d.\u201cWe need to keep meeting, keep considering information, keep making decisions. When you slow the spread you save lives.\u201d \n  Morrison confirms he has not been tested for coronavirus, because \u201cthere is no need, I have no symptoms\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 10.23pm GMT \n \n \n  9.42pm GMT  \n Parliament public galleries to be closed \n  \n  Speaking to the broadcaster Alan Jones, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed \u201cscale-back arrangements\u201d would be imposed when parliament meets next week, including staff not travelling to the capital and closing public viewing galleries. \n  He applauded the move by Woolworths to reserve a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and vulnerable people and said the violent scenes at shopping centres were disappointing and \u201cnot Australian\u201d. \n  \u201cEach of us have got to check each other on this kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \n  In response to a question about whether banks could be persuaded not to foreclose on small businesses, he said the government was discussing the issue with lenders. \n  \u201cThey are very real issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI am finding the banks to be very constructive.

But their family would not need to self-isolate because they were a \u201clow-risk group\u201d, he said. \n  Asked about false social media claims that NSW would be locked down, Morrison said traditional media should not report the claims and the government would reach out to social media companies to combat misinformation. \n  Asked about the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews\u2019 declaration of a public health emergency, Morrison said that was approved at the national cabinet on Sunday. \n  Morrison has defended the pace of rolling out national ads, saying \u201cseveral weeks ago we put in place the resources for a national campaign\u201d. \n  Guardian Australia has reported that a contract for the campaign was only awarded on 3 March but Morrison said the government had taken the disease seriously \u201csince mid January\u201d \u2013 citing travel bans and the evacuations from China and Japan. \n  \n Updated at 10.25pm GMT \n \n \n  9.33pm GMT  \n  \n  The number of Victoria cases of Covid-19 has risen by 14, taking the state\u2019s total to 71.  \n  \u201cMy understanding is the majority again are overseas acquired,\u201d says the chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton. \n  He also said Victoria would have \u201cfurther discussions around schools and the evidence for or against school closures\u201d. \n  \u201cBut we really want to work through broader strategies for social distancing and one of the key things to take out of this is that there is nothing magic about 500 people.\u201d \n  Sutton said while there was no ban on gatherings of smaller than 500 people, \u201cpeople should do the right thing\u201d. \n  Daniel Andrews said concerns about aged care would be discussed in detail at the national cabinet on Tuesday. \n  He said the advice at the moment was that \u201cclosing schools en masse ... could do more harm than good\u201d. \n  Crown Casino has been allowed to continue operating its gaming floor, with social distancing in place. Andrews said \u201ca number of machines have been turned off so there are bigger gaps between patrons\u201d. \n  The mandatory self-isolation did not apply to people from Pacific Island nations who had to travel through Australia or New Zealand to get home, he said. \n  \n Updated at 10.27pm GMT \n \n \n  9.27pm GMT  \n  \n  Morrison says 80% of people who contract coronavirus have mild symptoms, including the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and people should not panic.  \n  \u201cOur advice is that eight out or 10 Australians who contract this virus will have mild symptoms,\u201d he said.  \n  \u201cPeter Dutton, who has the virus, joined the national security committee meeting of cabinet by video conference yesterday. We changed our meeting arrangements so people are joining by video conference. The world can continue to turn. \n  \u201cShops remain open, the power is still on ... we can get about our daily life as best as we can. \n  \u201cA state of emergency is not a state of panic,\u201d he says, in regards to Victoria\u2019s announcement today.  \n  \n Updated at 10.28pm GMT \n \n \n  9.22pm GMT  \n  \n  Scott Morrison is now speaking on Channel Nine\u2019s Today show.  \n  The host Karl Stefanovic tells him he feels uncomfortable that schools are still open. Morrison says he is still following the advice of the chief medical officer and the experts.  \n  \u201cYou\u2019re not a doctor, Karl, and neither am I,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cI am interested in facts. I am a parent, you are a parent, I think we all have the same anxieties about the health of our kids. \n  \u201cThis could change in the future and if it does it is because of a change in the medical situation.\u201d  \n  \n Updated at 10.29pm GMT \n \n \n  9.18pm GMT  \n  \n  Brett Sutton, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, is now speaking.  \n  He says the ban on gatherings above 500 people does not apply to: \u201cAirports, public transportation, medical and health services, emergency services, aged care, prisons, correctional facilities, youth justice centres, parliament, food markets or an office building, factory or site of construction that is necessary for normal operation.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 10.29pm GMT \n \n \n  9.10pm GMT  \n Victoria declares state of emergency \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has just declared a state of emergency to combat the spread of coronavirus.  \n  That is effective from noon today and will last four weeks.  \n  \u201cIt is likely that state of emergency will be extended and will be in place for as long as it needs to be,\u201d Andrews says.  \n  That state of emergency also means that Victorian police can enforce self-isolation measures and punish those who do not comply.  \n  \u201cUnder the state of emergency that has been declared, it is an offence under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to not comply with the orders that have been made.  \n  \u201cThose orders relate to the mandatory \u2013 it is not optional in any way \u2013 mandatory home quarantine or at a hotel if you are not a resident. Now, that is a proportionate and appropriate response. \n  \u201cThese powers have never been used before,\u201d he says. \u201cThat gives, I hope, a sense of the unprecedented nature of this public health emergency\u201d.  \n  Andrews also warns against panic buying and emptying supermarket shelves and says residents should look after the most vulnerable. \n  \n Updated at 10.30pm GMT \n \n \n  9.06pm GMT  \n Potential jail time and fines for failing to self-isolate \n  \n  At a press conference this morning, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has just confirmed that police can fine or imprison people who fail to self-isolate, and arrest event organisers who defy the closure of events with more than 500 people.  \n  Yesterday Scott Morrison announced new restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including 14-day self-isolation for anyone arriving from overseas, and a 30-day ban on cruise ship arrivals.  \n  \u201cWhilst the chief medical officer can issue notices, police can enforce that and there are penalties in place for people who don\u2019t respect what we\u2019ve done, through the Public Health Act,\u201d Berejiklian said today.  \n  Yesterday the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaczszuk, said laws passed last month also allowed police to fine people $13,000 for not complying with self-isolation. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, also said similar.When asked if people could also report those who fail to comply, Berejiklian said yes but \u201chopes that it doesn\u2019t come to that\u201d. \n  \u201cYou can let the relevant authorities know, and the police can turn up and enforce that person to stay home. So we do have that provision. We\u2019ll be enacting that. \n  \u201cIf you\u2019re an event organiser and you have a planned event which will have 500 people at once, that can no longer take place. So if anybody doesn\u2019t follow those instructions, there\u2019s a hefty fine and also potential jail time.\u201d \n  Section 70 of the NSW Public Health Act says it is an offence not to comply with a public health order, and section 71 says police may arrest a person who contravenes public health orders \u2013 under certain circumstances.  \n  But the premier said she hoped that \u201cmost people will step up and do the right thing [and self-isolate]\u201d. \n  \u201cDon\u2019t just think of yourself and your own family ... you could unintentionally be infecting and causing the death of so many other people.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 10.18pm GMT \n \n \n  8.57pm GMT  \n  \n  Good morning and welcome back to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in Australia.  \n  This morning, Woolworths has announced a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and disabled people \u2013 to combat shelf shortages due to panic buying \u2013 while the University of Queensland will pause all its classes for a week.  \n  The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has also just spoken about potential powers the government can use to enforce self-isolation.

The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet had to correct its own evidence, after it told a senate inquiry Power was being paid $500,000. The money is an allowance for travel costs, not a salary.  \n   The Therapeutic Goods Administration has fined an Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing more than $150,000 for selling and promoting a solution containing industrial bleach as an alleged cure for coronavirus. \n   Coronavirus tests brought to Australia by the mining billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest at a cost of $200m to the Australian taxpayer are not being used by most state and territory governments and have instead been sent to the national medical stockpile. \n   Treasurer Josh Frydenberg tested negative for Covid-19 after a scare prompted by a coughing fit. \n   The federal government appointed its first deputy chief \u00admedical officer for mental health, Assoc Prof Ruth Vine. \n   Australia\u2019s Covid-19 toll rose to 98 after an 81-year-old woman, who was a passenger on the Ruby Princess, died in NSW overnight.  \n   Australia recorded 13 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday \u2013 seven in Victoria and six in NSW. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.04pm BST \n \n \n  11.14am BST  \n Some NSW pubs to reopen on Friday \n  \n  Pubs with restaurants and sit-down dining tables will be allowed to reopen on Friday, as part of the NSW government\u2019s already announced easing of restrictions.  \n  Cafes and restaurants were already slated to reopen \u2013 and the NSW treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, has clarified this includes the dining portions of some pubs.  \n  But only 10 people will be allowed in the premises at one time. And tables will still have be 1.5m apart.  \n  The rules are still unclear, and are a matter for the public health order, but a spokesperson for the Treasury told Guardian Australia that pubs would, most likely, not need an entirely separate restaurant section to be able to open.  \n  Pubs in which they served food at sit-down tables near a bar area would likely be allowed to open and operate as a restaurant, the spokesperson said.  \n  Alcohol could be served with a meal, but the bar itself would still be closed.  \n  \n Updated at 11.32am BST \n \n \n  10.31am BST  \n  \n   \n   \n    Jane Hume just told me it wasn\u2019t such a bad idea.... #auspol https://t.co/mkvjPOrtSu\u2014 PatriciaKarvelas (@PatsKarvelas) May 13, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.02am BST  \n  \n  And from earlier, here is Paul Karp\u2019s full story on Scott Morrison\u2019s explanation today on the sports rorts saga. \n   \n    Related: Sports rorts: Morrison says he sought authority on grant announcements, not funding decisions  \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.48am BST  \n Worksafe to investigate Cedar Meats outbreak \n  \n  From our reporter Matilda Boseley, Worksafe in Victoria will investigate the coronavirus cluster at the Cedar Meats abattoir.  \n   \n   \n    Breaking- WorkSafe has confirmed they are investigating the Covid-19 outbreak at #CedarMeats.

We\u2019ll bring you an update when we have it.  \n  \n Updated at 9.18am BST \n \n \n  8.58am BST  \n  \n  In his statement, Cameron Dick also said that two airlines were \u201ccritical to Australia\u2019s economy\u201d.  \n  The Queensland treasurer said: \n   \n   We have the opportunity to retain not only head office and crew staff in Queensland, but also to grow jobs in the repairs, maintenance and overhaul sector and support both direct and indirect jobs in our tourism sector. \n   We saw the punishing increase to the cost of flights after the Ansett collapse, and this government will not stand by and let that happen again. \n   Queensland Investment Corporation, led by CEO Damien Frawley, will advise government on all aspects of the bid, including the optimal partner group, the quantum and structure of the state\u2019s contribution, as well as probity and governance. \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.10am BST \n \n \n  8.44am BST  \n Queensland government to bid for Virgin Australia \n  \n  The Queensland state government will bid for Virgin Australia, the new treasurer, Cameron Dick, has announced. \n  In a statement, the treasurer said he has appointed Queensland Investment Corporation, a government-owned investment company, to pursue a bid that could include a \u201cdirect equity stake\u201d in the airline. \n  \u201cThe government\u2019s investment could take the form of a direct equity stake, a loan, guarantee or other financial incentives,\u201d Dick said. \n  \n Updated at 8.56am BST \n \n \n  8.29am BST  \n Senate votes down bid to make jobseeker rate permanent \n  \n  The Senate has voted down a motion to make the new jobseeker rate permanent.  \n  The unemployment benefit, which was formerly called Newstart, was at $40 a day until it was doubled at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.  \n  The motion from the Greens senator Rachel Siewert called for the increase, to about $1,115 a fortnight, to be made permanent. The rate has not been raised above inflation since 1994.  \n  Siewert said:  \n   \n   I can\u2019t see how anybody can think that it is OK to return the jobseeker payment to the old rate of $40 a day.  \n   We can and should choose to support people who are not in work, particularly when we know very well that we are in an economic downturn and it will be difficult for many people to find work. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.55am BST \n \n \n  8.13am BST  \n Travel agent boss resigns over 'uppercut' comments \n  \n  Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou here. Thanks to Amy Remeikis and Matilda Boseley for their incredible dual coronavirus and parliament blogging. \n  In some breaking news from media correspondent Amanda Meade, the head of Australia\u2019s peak body for travel agents has resigned after he said the A Current Affair host Tracy Grimshaw should be \u201cgiven a firm uppercut or a slap across the face\u201d. \n  Jayson Westbury made the comments in an industry webinar in which he criticised the show\u2019s coverage of the travel industry. \n   \n    Related: Travel industry boss resigns after saying Tracy Grimshaw needed 'a firm upper cut or a slap'  \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.29am BST \n \n \n  7.57am BST  \n  \n  On that note, I am going to hand you over to Naaman Zhou. \n  Your Canberra Guardian crew will be back with you from early tomorrow morning.

Take care of you. \n  \n Updated at 8.00am BST \n \n \n  7.49am BST  \n  \n  That feeling when it is the day after your birthday: \n  \n Updated at 7.54am BST \n \n \n  7.46am BST  \n  \n  Triggered. \n  Still not using his elbow. \n  \n Updated at 7.54am BST \n \n \n  7.42am BST  \n  \n  That feeling when no one wishes you a happy birthday: \n  \n Updated at 7.54am BST \n \n \n  7.36am BST  \n  \n  The president of the Australian Law Council, Pauline Wright, says the organisation has concerns about Peter Dutton\u2019s latest security bill: \n   \n   The proposal to reduce the age of minors who may be subject to questioning from 16 to 14 years and the conferral of powers on police to apprehend and detain persons for the purpose of bringing them in for compulsory questioning also requires detailed scrutiny by the Law Council, amongst the many other amendments. \n   The Law Council is concerned that the government is now rushing the Bill, despite having had over two years to develop the re-designed questioning legislation since the PJCIS tabled its report in May 2018. \n   Now there is a sense of urgency given that ASIO\u2019s current questioning powers are due to sunset in 7 September, and the amendments are set to commence by or before that date. \n   This is not a Bill to be hurried through. \n   The Law Council will need to carefully scrutinise the Bill and we look forward to providing a comprehensive submission to the inquiry. \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.27am BST  \n  \n  In a Sky News interview broadcast just now, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has stuck to the government\u2019s lines about taking a constructive and considered approach to the China relationship, while backbenchers speaking out are simply exercising free speech. \n  Interestingly, Payne said she had \u201cnever had a problem\u201d trying to connect with her counterpart. \n  The signs are that the trade minister, Simon Bimingham, hasn\u2019t had such luck, at least at this early stage. \n  Birmingham said during Senate question time today he was yet to secure a conversation with his Chinese counterpart, but hoped this could be arranged soon.  \n  On the barley and red meat issues, Birminham told the Senate that China had made clear publicly and privately that these were \u201ctechnical matters\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 7.46am BST \n \n \n  7.25am BST  \n  \n  So Christian Porter is talking on why the inquiry is necessary and Mark Dreyfus will respond on why it\u2019s terrible and then we will go to a vote, which Labor will lose.  \n  \n \n \n  7.24am BST  \n  \n  There is a division in the house as Labor tries to stop Christian Porter setting up an inquiry into class actions and litigation funding. \n  Here is Mark Dreyfus on why Labor doesn\u2019t want the inquiry: \n   \n   Litigation funding and class actions provide a vital path to justice for ordinary Australians trying to uphold their rights against wealthy defendants with vastly greater resources. \n   Just last November the federal court ruled in favour of the three lead applicants in a class action of more than 1,350 women who sued Johnson &amp; Johnson and two subsidiaries for negligence in relation to pelvic mesh implants. \n   It\u2019s no coincidence this inquiry was first proposed in March just days after 10,000 victims of the Morrison government\u2019s cruel robodebt scheme signed up to a class action to defend their legal rights. \n   Contrary to government claims, research by commercial law firm Allens found the total number of class action filings was actually down 20% in 2019.  \n   Shareholder actions were actually down 63% and so far this year there are just three new shareholder cases \u2013 none of which relate to Covid-19 matters. \n   Significantly, the biggest cause of new cases in 2019 came from consumer actions arising from the banking royal commission that the government voted 26 times to prevent. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.49am BST \n \n \n  7.11am BST  \n  \n  Daniel Hurst is watching Marise Payne talk with Kieran Gilbert over on Sky on this same issue, so we\u2019ll bring you that when the interview finishes airing.  \n  \n \n \n  7.10am BST  \n  \n  Patricia Karvelas asks Simon Birmingham how he can say the relationship between China and Australia hasn\u2019t soured, given China\u2019s reaction: \n   \n   I\u2019ve simply highlighted what the Chinese government has said publicly and privately in relation to these matters \u2013 they are technical issues in relation to trade practices and processes, that they relate to matters that have been ongoing or under investigation for periods relating to 12 to 18 months.  \n   They have said that.  \n   We have to respond as best as we can in good faith in putting forward the arguments that address those technical issues. If we\u2019re being told they are the reasons why these permits have been cancelled, or in relation to the barley dispute, here is the process it is being assessed under, well, the first port of response rightly for the Australian government is to engage in good faith, comprehensively, using evidence to refute any of the arguments put within those processes. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.50am BST \n \n \n  7.09am BST  \n  \n  The NRL player Nathan Cleary has been fined $1,000 by New South Wales police for breaking social distancing rules following the TikTok drama that has earned him a two-game ban and $30,000 fine for misleading the league\u2019s integrity unit. \n  \n Updated at 7.56am BST \n \n \n  7.08am BST  \n  \n  He is asked whether there is any timing on that chat. \n  Simon Birmingham: \n   \n   Well, look, the ball is very much in their court of the Chinese government.  \n   We have made very clear that I am available and keen to have a discussion where we can discuss and canvas some of these trade-related matters.  \n   There are other global issues in relation to WTO operation and the like that no doubt we will canvas as well during the conversation, but this is not the sole pathway for the Australian government to make representations to the Chinese government.  \n   That is why we have a very active embassy in Beijing, with strong connections and engagement into other avenues and parts of the Chinese government, and of course it\u2019s why we support industry in their direct engagement in response to the particular technical requests of what China has raised with us. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.52am BST \n \n \n  7.06am BST  \n  \n  Simon Birmingham is on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing. \n  Patricia Karvelas asks if he has heard back from his Chinese counterpart yet, about when is a good time to have a phone chat about the latest \u2018issues\u2019 that have flared up over trade: \n   \n   We don\u2019t have one scheduled as yet.  \n   I hope China will be willing to engage in those discussions, but they\u2019re not the only pathway we are pursuing to try to resolve these issues in relation to the beef sector and the barley industry and we\u2019ll make sure we pursue every avenue available to us, starting very much with using the technical administrative pathways that are available because of the nature of the type of issues that China has initiated investigations or actions around. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.53am BST \n \n \n  6.42am BST  \n  \n  Alternatively, before and after iso: \n   \n   \n    Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen-Start of #qt VS end of #qt @AmyRemeikis @GuardianAus #politicslive https://t.co/of5JUHNeyX pic.twitter.com/0gHDLwWTbU\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) May 13, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.45am BST \n \n \n  6.40am BST  \n Labor clashes with government over bipartisan Covid meetings \n  \n  Rewatching the end of question time, Tony Burke had a \u2018personal explanation\u2019 to make and spills some tea about the weekly meetings the opposition leadership has been having with the government leadership (which was the compromise offered after Anthony Albanese was denied a seat on the national cabinet, and the parliament wasn\u2019t sitting). After this, I am not sure if those weekly catch-ups will be ongoing. \n  Asked if he had claimed to have been misrepresented (the standard reason for a personal explanation), Burke says he does: \n   \n   Yesterday during debate on an amendment I had moved, which would have demanded the government produce the new sitting calendar, the leader of the House (Christian Porter) said statements I had personally made were inaccurate, by claiming that in private meetings, which I had personally attended, the government had, and I quote the leader of the House, \u2018clearly explained there will be additional sitting weeks\u2019, end quote. \n   This statement is false. \n   While I would normally not disclose the conduct of private meetings, given the leader of the House has made this false statement about me to the House, I wish to confirm the following four points. \n   One, in the meeting with the leadership of the government, on 7 May 2020, the government did not state that it would provide additional sitting weeks, but merely that it might. \n   Two, this was to be based on an assessment, that was to be taken, and I quote, \u2018a couple of days\u2019, end quote, after parliament had risen, based on whether there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of these sittings. \n   Three, given the virus has an incubation period of weeks not days, this position was always absurd.  \n   Four, the minister\u2019s misrepresentation of these statements also presumes the government has been forthcoming with accurate information at these meetings, which is challenged by the fact that on issues as straightforward as whether there would be changes to jobkeeper, the government has provided information at these meetings which was proven to be false the very next day. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.47am BST \n \n \n  6.23am BST  \n  \n  Kristina Keneally has given Labor\u2019s first response to Peter Dutton\u2019s latest bill: \n   \n   Labor is committed to the safety and security of all Australians and will always take the advice of our national security agencies.  \n   The powers in this legislation are ongoing matters which have been extensively considered since they were first created by John Howard. \n    We would expect the legislation introduced today \u2013 including any new measures \u2013 to be considered by the Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security, as is normal practice. \n   When the Government asks Australians to trust them \u2013 just like they have with the response to Covid-19 \u2013 it\u2019s only reasonable for their actions to be properly scrutinised. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.24am BST \n \n \n  6.19am BST  \n  \n  While question time was happening, you may have missed these stories: \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus tests brought to Australia by Andrew Forrest at $200m cost to taxpayers not being used  \n   \n   \n    Related: Murray-Darling systems not assessed for endangered listing after officials warned Coalition would not support it  \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.14am BST  \n  \n   \n   \n    Just a reminder: for months there have been questions about whether these sports grants were made with proper legal authority. No answers. Then obvious contradictions between the ANAO and the government about the exercise of authority. No answers. Anyone care? I do #qt #auspol\u2014 Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 13, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.12am BST  \n  \n  The NRL player Nathan Cleary could yet be fined by New South Wales police for breaching social distancing guidelines, despite having initially avoided any police sanctions, AAP reports.  \n  The Penrith Panthers star is to be interviewed again today after it was alleged he left his home during the day in question in contravention of the Covid-19 measures. \n  \u201cWe are looking at it,\u201d detective inspector Jason Pietruszka told AAP. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing his original information and we\u2019ll be speaking with him later on today. And if that information is found to be false, then he\u2019ll be issued with a ticket as per the health order. We\u2019ll treat it for what it is and he\u2019ll be given a ticket.\u201d \n  Cleary was originally cleared by police of breaking coronavirus restrictions when he was photographed with friends at his house. Five women received $1,000 police fines for flouting government protocols. However, after video emerged of Cleary in TikTok videos with the same group, the NRL handed him a two-game ban and $30,000 fine for being \u201cuntruthful\u201d in dealings with the integrity unit. \n  Cleary originally received a $10,000 fine, 60% suspended, as well as a suspended one-match ban after initial league investigations. \n  \n Updated at 6.16am BST \n \n \n  6.12am BST  \n  \n  As I typed that, I had to reload the page three times in order for it to post. \n  \n \n \n  6.11am BST  \n  \n  For some reason, every single MP who asks a dixer is getting a herogram lately, about just how crucial a cog they are to Australia\u2019s democracy. \n  Bert van Manen gets his for his \u201clongstanding interest\u201d in the NBN. \n  I also have a longstanding interest in the NBN. In that I would like it to work.  \n  \n Updated at 6.17am BST \n \n \n  6.09am BST  \n Government to 'refine' childcare package \n  \n  After the second question on failures within the Covid childcare package, Dan Tehan admits there is a need for \u201crefinements\u201d (which is just a word for fixes): \n   \n   What we have put in place was a significant, significant package, to enable the sector to get through the pandemic, and it included free childcare.  \n   It had three priority areas that we wanted to achieve through this, including making sure parents stayed engaged with their childcare centre, so when we came out of this pandemic they would be able to go back to that centre as they went back into employment.  \n   When we announced this, we said we would have a four-week review process.  \n   And that four-week review process has taken place.  \n   We are now looking at that review and we will have further refinements to make.  \n   As you know, when you make a significant change like we did, we paused the existing system, and in the space of days, put in place a new system. And we knew, at that time, there would be certain unintended consequences that we would have to work through, and that\u2019s why we put a four-week review process into play. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.12am BST \n \n \n  6.03am BST  \n  \n  Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, has asked about evidence from the audit office that on 26 March 2019 \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s office had advised the minister\u2019s office that it was expected that the minister would write to the prime minister to seek \u2018authority\u2019 on the approved projects and inform the prime minister of the \u2018roll out plan\u2019\u201d. \n  In response, Scott Morrison doubled down on his statement to parliament that \u201cno authorisation\u201d was provided by him and Bridget McKenzie was the decision-maker on sports grants. \n  \u201cThe only authority sought was in relation to announcements,\u201d he said. \n  So Morrison has produced a distinction between authority to give sports grants to recipient clubs and authority to announce the decisions. That is not a distinction made by the Australian National Audit Office in its evidence \u2013 which was that the PMO asked McKenzie to seek \u201c\u2019authority\u2019 on the approved projects\u201d, not authority on the announcements. \n  Let\u2019s also remember that McKenzie said she signed the final brief on 4 April 2019, and yet a flurry of late changes were made, including on 11 April, the day the election was called, even after the government went into caretaker mode. \n  The question also got a try in the Senate, where Mathias Cormann employed the same defence that Morrison was responsible for \u201cannouncement arrangements\u201d but the projects \u201chad been approved by the minister\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 6.14am BST \n \n \n  6.00am BST  \n  \n  That\u2019s it. One question on an issue which saw the government spend $100m in a way no one can explain whether they had the legal authority to do so. \n  \n \n \n  5.57am BST  \n  \n  In Senate question time, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young raises concerns about the conflict of interest arrangements for members of the Covid commission. \n  Hanson-Young tells the Senate the government \u201chas stacked their Covid commission full of mining executives and developers who are hellbent on cutting green tape\u201d. She asks what the government will do to \u201censure their mates aren\u2019t feathering their own nests\u201d. \n  The leader of the government in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, rejects the arguments in the questions, arguing the membership is \u201ca broad cross-section\u201d.  \n  He says individuals are required to declare their own interests. \n   \n   Let me just say that the people who are serving on the National Covid Coordination Commission are distinguished Australians who are providing great service to our country at a difficult time. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.09am BST \n \n \n  5.57am BST  \n  \n  Oh thank Beyonce. We get to sports rorts. \n  Richard Marles to Scott Morison: \n   \n   Why did the prime minister tell the house on February 27 that in relation to sports rorts and I quote, authority for these decisions was the minister for sport, when in fact the audit officers told the parliament that the prime minister\u2019s office told the minister for sports and I quote, it was expected that the minister would write to the prime minister to seek authority on the approved projects. \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n   I refer the member to my many statements on this. The authority for making the decisions in relation to that program was the minister for sport. That is the fact, Mr Speaker.  \n   It may be inconvenient for the opposition that that is the fact, that that is the fact, Mr Speaker. The only authority sought from the prime minister\u2019s office and for myself was in relation to announcements. \n   \n  The questions move on to a dixer, giving Stuart Robert a chance to act like a minister.  \n  \n Updated at 6.20am BST \n \n \n  5.54am BST  \n  \n  \u201cWhen the chips are down with Australians, all Australians chip in,\u201d says Alan Tudge, sending me looking for chips to fill my existential despair at political discourse in this country.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.53am BST  \n  \n  Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: \n   \n   Figures released today show annual wages growth slowed to a two-year low in the first quarter of this year before the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. Is this the kind of economy the government wants to snap back to? \n   \n  Frydenberg:  \n   \n   As I said in the House yesterday, the impact on household consumption and household savings, there will be an impact on wages and there will be a significant, a significant impact across the economy.  \n   But I do want to point out to the member for Rankin that under this government, the minimum wage has gone up every year, Mr Speaker. Every year, Mr Speaker. And the reality is ...  \n   \n  Chalmers: It didn\u2019t go up under you! \n  Frydenberg:  \n   \n   The member for Rankin is getting angry because he is irrelevant to the debate. He has been talking down the economy before the crisis and he is now talking down the economy through the crisis and he will be talking down the economy after the crisis. The Australian people understand and trust the Coalition to manage the economy better than Labor ever will. \n   \n  I mean, it is not talking down to point out what was actually happening. But ugh. \n  Meanwhile, not covered off, sports rorts or the Angus Taylor grassland questions, because it is much better to dress up political points as questions, then try to get the government on the record. Apparently.  \n  \n Updated at 6.06am BST \n \n \n  5.46am BST  \n  \n  Jason Clare to Michael Sukkar: \n   \n   Will the government develop a housing construction industry stimulus plan to keep Australia\u2019s almost 1 million bricklayers, carpenters, electricians and lots of other workers in the housing construction industry in a job? \n   \n  Look. There are a lot of words Sukkar says in response here, but none of them are in the form of an actual answer and we only have one life to live. \n  Andrew Laming has now brought Christian Porter to the dispatch box, and he\u2019s decided to use David Littleproud\u2019s template of a loudly striped tie in lieu of a personality today, so I am going to go get a cup of tea.  \n  \n Updated at 6.04am BST \n \n \n  5.40am BST  \n  \n   \n   And I thank the very fine member for Wentworth for that question,\u201d says Karen Andrews to Dave Sharma. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.41am BST \n \n \n  5.39am BST  \n  \n  Tony Burke to Josh Frydenberg: \n   \n   Can the treasurer explain why an 18-year-old living at home and has been working a shift a week at a McDonald\u2019s franchise is receiving the full $1,500 jobkeeper wage subsidy but a full-time Australian worker at Dnata providing catering services to Qantas with a mortgage to repay is not eligible? \n   \n  Frydenberg: \n   \n   Firstly, let me say we very much understand the difficult circumstances that businesses and workers right across the country are facing with this coronavirus pandemic. As the honourable member said himself in this House yesterday, this is a health crisis that has created an economic crisis.  \n   Now, Mr Speaker, we responded with $130bn jobkeeper program, we set out very clearly what were the criteria for eligibility under that program including for full-time workers, for part-time workers, for long-term casuals based on a definition in the Fair Work Act as well we doubled the jobseeker payment effectively, the old Newstart, Mr Speaker, which is $1,100 a fortnight, Mr Speaker. \n   We have taken unprecedented economic steps. Some people will be eligible for the jobseeker program, others for the jobkeeper program. More than a million Australians are on the jobseeker program, and when it comes to jobkeeper program, over 800,000 businesses are formally enrolled, representing 5.5 million Australian workers. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.43am BST \n \n \n  5.36am BST  \n  \n  Tanya Plibersek to Josh Frydenberg: \n   \n   My question is to the treasurer: Can the treasurer explain why a university student working one shift per week receives the full $1,500 jobkeeper wage subsidy but their full-time university tutor with three kids to support is not eligible? \n   \n  Frydenberg: \n   \n   Well, Mr Speaker, we set out very clearly that with respect to universities that they would be subject to the threshold tests of 30% and 50%, depending on their turnover, but we also made the decision as a government to provide the commonwealth grants to the universities to ensure that they are receiving money equivalent to what their enrolments would have been pre-Covid.  \n   Mr Speaker, that\u2019s some $18bn. We will see government support for the university sector over this year, that\u2019s very substantial indeed. \n   \n  Sidenote \u2013 Frydenberg is showing as much enthusiasm to sit in the chamber today as I do to engage with Rick and Morty.  \n  \n Updated at 5.40am BST \n \n \n  5.34am BST  \n  \n  Nick McKim is one of the first out of the block to criticise the latest bill to expand the powers of Australia\u2019s security agencies (the Dutton bill we have been reporting on in the blog today): \n   \n   Yet again, Peter Dutton is trying to increase powers of security agencies without even trying to explain his reasons. \n   Nor has he tried to give any possible justification for the need to interrogate children as young as 14. \n   To use the pandemic as cover for the increased scope of the surveillance state is dangerous and cynical. \n   The National Terrorism Threat in Australia hasn\u2019t increased for more than five years, and yet we have been confronted with wave after wave of legislation. \n   There have been more than 200 pieces of \u2018counter terror\u2019 legislation passed in Australia since 2001 and very few have been relaxed or withdrawn. \n   Australia desperately needs a Charter of Rights to protect our basic freedoms. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.03am BST \n \n \n  5.30am BST  \n  \n  Every single dixer being asked just reminds me how many frustrated would-be school captains sit on the government backbenches.  \n  \n \n \n  5.29am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   How can the Australian people trust the prime minister with Covid-19 recovery when he was complacent in the lead up to the bushfires despite a clear warning from experts and months after the bushfires debris is still there but, more importantly, survivors are still living in caravans and showering in community halls. \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n   This government, Mr Speaker, this government put in place the national bushfire recovery fund in January this year, Mr Speaker \u2013 $2bn was set aside to support the work of the national bushfire recovery agency, Mr Speaker.  \n   That fund was intended to acquit some $500m by June 30 of this year. We estimate that that figure will exceed over $1bn by June 30 this year.  \n   Small business support grants of some $10,000 have now been provided to over 170,000 small businesses affected across the bushfire-affected areas.  \n   In total, small business support has been over $200m to support those small businesses that were so devastated. Mr Speaker, there has also been 1.5m approvals for small businesses on the grants up to $50m, $50,000 I should say, for small businesses seeking their support.  \n   Primary producer grants have been provided to the tune of some $127m to primary producers who are affected by these arrangements.  \n   The work is being done to clear debris and that estimated cost is over half $1bn, Mr Speaker, over $500m. \n   And as was reported earlier this week, South Australia will have largely completed that task very shortly. New South Wales, who are managing that work, will have completed that task by the end of June as indicated earlier this year. And in Victoria, we understand that that task will be completed by August of this year. \n   As the leader of the opposition knows, the matters of accommodation for those are affected and they are matters handled by the states and territories and we have not received, to the best of my knowledge, that any request outstanding from the commonwealth to provide support for accommodation in these communities, and I look to the minister for management and he indicates that is the case. Mr Speaker, we will deal with crises every time they impact on this country and we will do it methodically and steadily and Australians are seeing that in action. If the leader of the opposition wants to these things, that is a matter for him. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.38am BST \n \n \n  5.22am BST  \n  \n  Bob Katter has the crossbench question today, and he uses the word \u2018can\u2019 to start his sentence, so you would assume it is a question, but it is actually just another Katter word-soup that leaves everyone looking like Bob Katter usually looks whenever someone asks him his name. \n   \n   North Queensland is shovel ready and Covid-19 free. The rail line, the gasification. Not absorbing money but making money projects and back in black, highway to hell. Treasurer, cough up the money. Make money. \n   \n  Josh Frydenberg barely even cracks a smile. He says the government is moving forward with north Queensland projects, before giving the nod to Angus Taylor, who, from the backbench, encourages Katter to keep talking to the Clean Energy Corporation.  \n  \n Updated at 5.27am BST \n \n \n  5.18am BST  \n  \n  Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   What is the government doing to assist red meat growers and producers affected by recent trade restrictions announced by China and to protect the thousands of jobs currently at risk including abattoir workers in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales? \n   \n  Morrison: \n   \n   We hold concerns for the way this issue is being progressed at this point in time. This is a matter that the government has been raising now for a considerable period of time.  \n   In fact I have done so on several occasions in my direct meetings with the premier, most recently late last year. \n   So this is an issue that has been running for some time in relation to dumping. We reject any suggestion of those matters being relevant to Australia\u2019s exports, particularly of barley. \n   Australian agriculture is not one supported by subsidy, it is one supported by the ingenuity and good management of the Australian agricultural sector. And so any suggestion that Australia\u2019s agricultural exports are the subject of government subsidisation is rejected.  \n   And these are the points that we make directly as part of a comprehensive and strategic partnership that was concluded many years ago and we are continuing to use the channels of that relationship and that partnership to be able to progress those matters as well as directly with the relevant authorities in China regarding their anti-dumping review in relation to barley.  \n   Similarly, relations in matter to abattoirs are important to progress. They relate to what is claimed to be paperwork and administration issues in relation to Australian meat exports and we will continue to advocate and set out the Australian case clearly. \n   Let me be clear about one thing. Australia stands firmly behind our agricultural producers and we stand firmly about where we see the role of the Australian economy in the broader world. We have great confidence in our outlook as a trading nation and we engage with all partners in good faith with the purpose of ensuring the increasing global trade. \n   That is the basis for our relationship the Chinese government when it comes to a comprehensive strategic partnership. It works across many different areas and has been a highly successful agreement. From time to time there will be differences in views and we will progress them constructively in the national interest, always in the national interest. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.23am BST \n \n \n  5.16am BST  \n  \n  Michael McCormack is at the dispatch box, talking about fibre and whatnot, but is only serving to remind me that his speeches are a pretty wonderful substitute for All-Bran. \n  \n Updated at 5.25am BST \n \n \n  5.14am BST  \n  \n  And as you can see, we are back to the non-answers, non-acknowledgement, and the old \u2018deflect and attack\u2019 lines. Cool, cool, cool. \n  \n Updated at 5.15am BST \n \n \n  5.13am BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: \n   \n   My question is addressed to the prime minister: Does the prime minister stand by his claim businesses, the economy and his budget will snap back? \n   \n  Morrison:  \n   \n   I have every confidence in Australian businesses, Mr Speaker, and it\u2019s more than confidence in Australian businesses to rebuild on the other side of this crisis.  \n   I have confidence of businesses being at the centre of our economy and the regrowth that we will see in our economy that will support the incomes and livelihoods of Australians, not just now, but in the decades into the future because as Liberal and Nationals, we have never believed that government should be at the centre of the economy, that Australians should see a future for themselves, only being dependent on the support of other taxpayers, but seeing their own livelihoods being supported by businesses investing and creating jobs, Mr Speaker. \n   Some 1.5 million jobs created over these last six and a half years and those jobs have been decimated, Mr Speaker, by this terrible Covid crisis that has hit the world. But in the same way when we came to government and we rebuilt the nation\u2019s finances and we rebuilt the strength of the economy, Mr Speaker, and, Mr Speaker, that led to 1.5 million Australians getting into jobs.  \n   Australians can have confidence on the other side of this crisis the government, Mr Speaker, can apply the same discipline, the same faith and the same confidence in Australians\u2019 spirits and the innovative nature that we have seen as businesses have adapted in the, in this crisis.  \n   Now the leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, may want to engage in the semantics of this, but I can tell you what I\u2019m engaged in, Mr Speaker \u2013 and that is, that is, Mr Speaker \u2013 the fortitude and the strength of the Australian people and the strength of the Australian economy, which even still in the midst of this crisis, even still, with the delivery of the single largest income support package this country has ever seen. \n   Rating agencies around the world know we\u2019ve got this covered and it\u2019s true as we sought to raise the finances necessary to pay for that economic lifeline to Australians, then the subscription of our bonds, Mr Speaker, has been subscribed over and over and over again and the ... reason for that, Mr Speaker, is because people have confidence in this country.  \n   I have confidence in ... this country and I believe this country will bounce back and bounce strongly under the leadership of this government. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.20am BST \n \n \n  5.07am BST  \n Question time begins \n  \n  Chris Bowen gets today\u2019s first question: \n   \n   The Australian Psychological Society, Headspace and other experts say many Australians will need more than 10 mental health consultations to cope with the flow-on effects of Covid-19. To the government\u2019s credit, it adopted Labor\u2019s suggestion to increase the cap on Medicare mental health services in response to this summer\u2019s bushfires. Will it do the same in relation to Covid-19? \n   \n  Greg Hunt: \n   \n   One of the things we have done is invest very strongly in mental health.  \n   There have been a range of inputs and I thank the opposition for their input and I thank all of those who have contributed. In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we have invested $669m in telehealth of which I\u2019m advised 47.7% of all consultations in the previous week with regards to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone.  \n   In addition to that, what we have also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health.  \n   So it doesn\u2019t have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines.  \n   What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services in conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there were psychological and psychiatric items that were also made available. On top of that, there was a $74m investment focusing on support services for people, mostly online or through telehealth, through organisations such as the Black Dog Institute for healthcare workers, Origin for young people, Lifeline, Kids Line, so many other different support groups. And in particular, Beyond Blue has led the coronavirus activity.  \n   So with to other proposals, the government will always consider them. What we have done already is on the advice of the mental health officers, the chief medical officer, in particular the chair \u2013 or CEO \u2013 of the National Mental Health Commission and the prime minister\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, establish the arrangements which are in place. These have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period and where there are proposals we\u2019d always review them.  \n   What we have done so far, I would say, is potentially world leading and in particular the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week and we are making very good process with the states and I want to thank the prime minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.29am BST \n \n \n  4.53am BST  \n  \n  Bob Katter is currently on ABC TV looking like he just heard audio of one of his speeches. \n  \n Updated at 4.54am BST \n \n \n  4.50am BST  \n  \n  We are on the downhill run to question time. \n  Given it is no longer economy day, expect to hear about some of the other issues which have not been given the attention they deserve. \n  \n Updated at 4.52am BST \n \n \n  4.39am BST  \n  \n  AAP has the deets on the new deputy chief medical officer for mental health: \n  Australia has a new mental health official to help prevent a spike in suicides related to the coronavirus. \n  Former chief psychiatrist of Victoria, Ruth Vine, has been appointed as the country\u2019s first deputy chief medical officer for mental health. \n  Vine will listen to community concerns and provide advice to the federal government, with a focus on anxiety linked to social distancing and economic stress. \n  Health minister Greg Hunt announced the appointment on Wednesday, saying the Covid-19 pandemic, bushfires and drought had affected Australians\u2019 mental health. \n  \u201cThese impacts will be felt by people of all ages and across all our communities,\u201d he told parliament. \n  Hunt said the government was monitoring the use of mental health services so it can respond to demand. \n  Australia\u2019s political leaders will discuss a national mental health pandemic response plan on Friday. \n  The minister also intends to make expanded access to telehealth services a permanent fixture. \n  Government modelling has forecast a 50% increase in suicide cases directly related to the economic shutdown and the associated distress. \n  The modelling also points to the possibility of suicides outstripping direct deaths from coronavirus. \n  \u201cOne of the things we are aware of is that whilst we\u2019re practising physical distancing we should also be engaging in the social contact over the phone, in whatever way we can, to tell people that we\u2019re there, we understand,\u201d Hunt said. \n  \u201cThey may be isolated but they\u2019re not alone.\u201d \n  Professor Vine will sit alongside chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, who recommended mental health be treated as a priority. \n  Suicide Prevention Australia and the National Mental Health Commission both welcomed her appointment, saying it recognised the importance of mental health. \n  Lifeline 13 11 14 \n  beyondblue 1300 22 4636 \n  \n Updated at 4.41am BST \n \n \n  4.16am BST  \n 'We need more democracy': Greens ramp up calls for parliament to return as usual \n  \n  The Greens are getting louder in the calls to have parliament return as usual ahead of August. It was adjourned until August at the last emergency sitting, but given that the government is attempting to reopen the economy, it kinda has to reopen parliament too. So that\u2019s why we are here in this sitting, which Scott Morrison called a \u201ctrial\u201d, but is actually just parliament (trials are not a thing with parliament. It either sits or it doesn\u2019t and the parliament decides how it makes that happen.)  \n  Yesterday Christian Porter said a revised sitting calendar was being worked on to bring back parliament ahead of the August scheduled sitting, but there has been no word on when that will be made public.  \n  Larissa Waters says parliament needs to be recalled after this sitting as soon as possible.  \n   \n   The Covid crisis response and the plan for recovery demand more transparency in government decision-making. The Senate Covid committee plays a critical role, but is no substitute for full parliamentary oversight.  \n   We need more democracy during this time, not less. We need to ensure that Australia\u2019s recovery is fair, effective, and guided by expert advice. We need parliament to return. \n   The Greens are calling for both houses to sit in June to fix gaps in the jobkeeper scheme, introduce rights to pandemic leave, consider banking royal commission legislation, and debate the merits of the government\u2019s proposed gas-led recovery. \n   We must ensure we don\u2019t come out the other side having brought this coronovirus under control but finding ourselves with our democracy eroded and hard-fought for rights lost.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.20am BST \n \n \n  4.12am BST  \n  \n  The Community and Public Sector Union \u2013 which represents non-academic staff at unis \u2013 is pretty annoyed about a deal between the NTEU and management allowing pay cuts. \n  Troy Wright, the CPSU NSW assistant general secretary, said the deal was \u201ccooked up behind closed doors between academics and universities\u201d and will cut pay, particularly for the lowest paid staff.  \n  He said: \n   \n   A 15% wage cut may only be a haircut for high-paid academics, but for the professional staff of universities it is a life-altering cut to their pay packet. \n   There are a range of smarter cost saving measures universities could take before an indiscriminate slash to wages. But, it would seem the NTEU\u2019s leather-elbow-patched-brigade would rather librarians, student services and admin staff on less than $70,000 take a 15% cut to their pay, than see their travel allowances reduced. \n   There is a better way to find savings and secure jobs. We\u2019re going to each NSW university under pressure and asking them to open their books and demonstrate they\u2019ve exhausted all their borrowings. We\u2019re also calling on them to cease capital works, terminate contingent labour and have a through review of executive salaries before they begin slashing the take home pay of all employees. \n   This framework isn\u2019t binding - it\u2019s an entirely theoretical exercise that universities may or may not sign up to. Rather than going on a case-by-case basis to find savings and compromises, this is a knee-jerk response which leaves workers worse off.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.14am BST \n \n \n  4.08am BST  \n ACT reports no new Covid-19 cases \n  \n  The ACT remains active (and known) Covid-19 case free, with no one diagnosed with the virus in the last 24 hours.  \n  \n Updated at 4.11am BST \n \n \n  4.07am BST  \n Victorian police change lockdown fine procedure \n  \n  Police in Victoria now need approval from their supervisor before issuing a fine for breaching lockdown laws.  \n  The change means that only two people were fined for breaching lockdown laws in the past 24-hours \u2013 and remember the relaxed restrictions only came into force at midnight last night.  \n  Requiring supervisor approval is a significant change, when you consider how many people have been hit with $1,600 on-the-spot fines in the seven weeks since the first stay at home directions were issued. It also pretty much removes the \u201con-the-spot\u201d element \u2013 police said it\u2019s likely there will now be delays \u201cin a breach being detected and a fine being issued\u201d.  \n  In a statement, Victoria police said the new process was due to the updated directions from the chief health officer, announced on Monday.  \n  You can read those new directions here. \n  Police said: \n  \u201cVictoria police recognises there may be some genuine ambiguity from the community and police members alike regarding the interpretation of the new directions. \n  \u201cThis new process will assist in providing a fair and balanced approach to all breaches and ensure accuracy in offence determination. \n  \u201cIt also ensures a heightened level of discretion.\u201d \n  As we\u2019ve previously reported, there was a fair bit of confusion in the public about what the previous orders meant and how they were enforced as well and accusations of \u201caggressive\u201d policing. \n  The timing of the rule change by police, coming the day after police were criticised for not issuing more on-the-spot fines at an anti-lockdown protest, is probably going to ruffle a few feathers.  \n  \n Updated at 4.12am BST \n \n \n  4.00am BST  \n  \n  Over in the Senate, Kim Carr is absolutely teeing off against the Daily Telegraph stories on the \u201cWuhan lab\u201d stories. \n  The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age\u2019s Eryk Bagshaw and Anthony Galloway did an excellent deep dive into the origins of those stories, here. \n  \n Updated at 4.02am BST \n \n \n  3.48am BST  \n Payne rejects suggestions government not setting right tone with China \n  \n  The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has pushed back at suggestions the government is not setting the right tone in its dealings with China. \n  Earlier today the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, called on Payne and the government to \u201ctake control of this and exercise a little bit of discipline in their ranks\u201d to avoid inflaming tensions. \n  \u201cIt would be pretty handy if we heard more from the foreign minister and less from people like George Christensen,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Murrumbateman. \n  During an interview with Kieran Gilbert on Sky News \u2013 which will go to air later today \u2013 Payne said she did not want to be drawn into an argument with the opposition, but was focused on managing Australia\u2019s \u201ccomplex international relationships\u201d. \n  She said the government was handling the issues in a considered way in the Australian interest. \n   \n   I think the tone is being very carefully set by the prime minister and by me in my capacity and other ministers who are engaged on these issues,\u201d Payne said. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.57am BST \n \n \n  3.47am BST  \n  \n  Peter Dutton reports the anti-fraud taskforce it established in relation to the bushfire and Covid-19 payments, \u201cTaskforce Iris\u201d has made its first arrest \u2013 a 34-year-old western Sydney man: \n   \n   It is alleged that since January 2020, the man had assumed up to 11 identities as well as 53 fictitious identities to submit a number of claims for government benefits. These include: \n   \n   \n    \n    65 fraudulent claims for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment in the context of the summer 2019-20 bushfires; \n    1 fraudulent claim for Newstart allowance; \n    2 fraudulent claims for jobseeker payments, which includes the coronavirus supplement that is intended to support the rate of jobseeker payment due to the impact of the coronavirus. \n    \n   \n   \n   The value of fraudulent payments the man allegedly tried to claim is approximately $70,550 in total. \n   The man has been charged with a number of commonwealth offences, including obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Some of these offences carry penalties of up to a maximum of 10 years in prison. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.50am BST \n \n \n  3.45am BST  \n  \n  OK, we have a little more information on what the Covid commissioners are being paid, following questioning from Katy Gallagher to Stephanie Foster from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. \n  Here\u2019s who is on it: \n   \n   Neville Power. Chairman, National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC)  \n   David Thodey AO, deputy chairman \n   The Hon Greg Combet AM \n   Jane Halton AO PSM FAICD FIPPA \n   Paul Little AO \n   Catherine Tanna \n   Peter Harris AO chief executive officer \n   Andrew N Liveris \n   \n  You can find out more about who is on the commission, here. \n  Foster says there are five commissioners supporting the chair. \n  One has asked not to be paid, four are working for a day rate of $2,000, with three working around two days a week and one working one day a week.  \n  Katy Gallagher asks what Nev Power is receiving as chair and is told that, as a full-time roll (for six months) he is receiving $500,000, which is also meant to cover his travel and accomodation costs.  \n  \n Updated at 3.47am BST \n \n \n  3.30am BST  \n  \n  Labor also believes the government\u2019s sudden interest in medical cannabis exports is related to One Nation\u2019s position on the consultation period for enterprise agreements, Paul Karp tells me. \n  One Nation\u2019s position on that was to push back by suggesting it will allow the shorter consultation (one day) but limit the effect of cuts to 12 months. \n  \n Updated at 3.34am BST \n \n \n  3.28am BST  \n Nev Power paid $500,000 to head Covid commission for six months \n  \n  Nev Power\u2019s salary has just been made public in the Covid committee. He will be paid $500,000 for six months work.  \n  He is heading up the business link in the Covid Commission. Most of the other commissioners are being paid $2,000 a day. At the moment they are working about two days a week.  \n  \n Updated at 3.57am BST \n \n \n  3.25am BST  \n  \n  So yes, that one will be sent to the parliamentary security and intelligence committee, I would suspect, but keep in mind it has been entered into the parliament with very little fanfare during a pandemic. \n  Given that it allows for 14-year-olds to be questioned by security agencies, increases surveillance, adds in \u201cacts of foreign interference\u201d and \u201cpolitically motivated violence\u201d into reasons for a questioning warrant, which are some pretty broad definitions, and makes it easier (streamlining is just another word for easier) for tracking devices to be used, including oral authorisations for a questioning warrant, there needs to be a lot more attention paid to this one.  \n  \n Updated at 3.35am BST \n \n \n  3.19am BST  \n Peter Dutton bill allows for Asio questioning of 14-year-olds \n  \n  In fact, the latest Peter Dutton bill does quite a bit: \n  1. The bill amends the compulsory questioning framework in the Asio Act by: \n  \u00b7 enabling Asio\u2019s continued use of questioning warrants, but removing its ability to use questioning and detention warrants; \n  \u00b7 replacing the existing detention framework with a more limited apprehension framework to ensure attendance during questioning and to prevent contact with others or the destruction of information; \n  \u00b7 enabling the use of questioning warrants in relation to espionage, politically motivated violence (including terrorism) and acts of foreign interference, as defined in section 4 of the Asio Act, rather than only in relation to terrorism offences; \n  \u00b7 streamlining the process for requesting and issuing a questioning warrant by enabling the attorney general to issue questioning warrants directly, removing the role of the issuing authority; \n  \u00b7 enabling Asio to request, and the attorney general to issue, questioning warrants orally in an emergency; \n  \u00b7 amending the eligibility requirements for appointment of prescribed authorities, to enable a broader pool of qualified persons to be appointed to this role; \n  \u00b7 providing the power for a police officer to conduct a search of a person who is apprehended in connection with a questioning warrant, and the ability to seize dangerous items and items that could be used to communicate the existence of the warrant or escape from custody, with an additional ability to seize items of intelligence relevant to the questioning matter, when authorised by the attorney general; \n  \u00b7 introducing screening measures and person searches for people attending questioning, either as the subject of the questioning warrant or others involved in the questioning process such as parents, and the ability of a police officer to retain any dangerous items and communications devices found in order to ensure the safety of those involved in questioning, and the integrity of the questioning; \n  \u00b7 subject to a number of safeguards \u2013 permitting Asio to seek a questioning warrant in relation to minors aged 14 to 18 years old, but only where the minor is themselves the target of an Asio investigation in relation to politically motivated violence; \n  \u00b7 strengthening the right to legal representation during questioning while retaining the ability to prevent contact with specific lawyers due to security concerns, and to remove a lawyer who is unduly disruptive during questioning; \n  \u00b7 introducing the ability of the independent prescribed authority to appoint a lawyer for the subject of a questioning warrant in certain circumstances; and \n  \u00b7 enabling a questioning warrant to be executed following the laying of charges against the person who is the subject of a questioning warrant, or where charges against that person are likely, and allow for the questioning to cover matters that are the subject of those charges with appropriate protections in relation to the person\u2019s fair trial. \n  \n Updated at 3.56am BST \n \n \n  3.17am BST  \n  \n  That new security bill Peter Dutton introduced into the parliament this morning includes a lot of amendments to \u201ctracking devices\u201d and internal authorisations within security agencies, for them to be used. \n  Which means security agencies could approve the use of tracking devices internally. They wouldn\u2019t need a warrant.  \n  From the explanatory notes: \n   \n    The Bill also amends the surveillance device framework in the ASIO Act to promote increased operational agility, mitigate the risk to ASIO surveillance operatives engaging in physical surveillance and to help resolve the current disadvantage faced by ASIO when engaging in joint operations with law enforcement. The Bill amends the ASIO Act in this regard by: \n   \u00b7 enabling ASIO to use tracking devices with internal authorisation in certain circumstances, rather than requiring a warrant; \n   \u00b7 clarifying that the surveillance device framework is permissive and does not require ASIO to obtain a warrant where conduct would not otherwise be unlawful; and \n   \u00b7 updating the definition of \u2018tracking device\u2019 and effectively modernising ASIO\u2019s capabilities.  \n   \n  You can find the whole bill here. \n  \n Updated at 3.35am BST \n \n \n  3.07am BST  \n  \n  So that is a yes \u2013 Pauline Hanson is in the box seat for those disallowance motions Paul has been reporting about.  \n  And on the same day, the government is just coincidently trying to rush through a piece of legislation on medical cannabis she has wanted, that it only just introduced to the parliament today.  \n  \n Updated at 3.36am BST \n \n \n  3.05am BST  \n  \n  Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick has confirmed that his party will support the Labor/Greens disallowance to help universities access jobkeeper, and the Labor motion to extend the wage subsidy to foreign government-owned companies with local workers. \n  He said: \n   \n   The jobkeeper money is directed at Australian workers - not the companies. \n   \n  That was the same argument the Liberal MP Craig Kelly made in the Coalition party room yesterday when sticking up for workers at the airline catering company Dnata. \n  The Transport Workers\u2019 Union and Australian Council of Trade Unions are both lobbying senators to pass the disallowances. \n  No word on Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation but, given that Lambie and Centre Alliance are on board, they are the swing votes. \n  \n Updated at 3.37am BST \n \n \n  3.02am BST  \n  \n  I am still making my way through reading this legislation, but yes, this is in there. \n   \n   \n    Under cover of a pandemic Dutton quietly tables legislation to allow kids as young as 14 to be detained by ASIO.

Over the last few decades, our universities have bet big on the international student dollar. Their institutions have boomed from what has been a very lucrative business. But they have become badly overexposed ... \n    Universities argue that they\u2019ve pursued this market by necessity. They argue insufficient government funding pushed them down this path. It\u2019s a convenient story that attempts to absolve universities from responsibility for decisions they have made, and it\u2019s a false one. \n   \n  Paterson noted that increasing international enrolments coincided with uncapping of university places, growing domestic student places and government funding. \n  He reveals that he\u2019s been sent details of the University of Queensland\u2019s remuneration structure. He claims one of the vice-chancellor\u2019s performance indicators is to \u201ccontinue to work towards a sound and strategic positioning in China\u201d. \n  UQ is also supposed to cultivate students from south-east Asia and India, but Paterson says it has had less success doing so. \n  Paterson argued that over-reliance on China particularly puts rights including \u201cfree speech, or the principle of free and open academic inquiry, or the right to protest for students\u201d at risk, given the stance of the Chinese Communist party. He argued against direct funding of courses by the Chinese government and alleged inadequate protection of academic freedom at the Confucius Institute. \n  Paterson said: \n   \n   Given that we now know that the vice-chancellor was financially incentivised to deliver closer relations with the CCP, it is no wonder that the University of Queensland has found itself in such a predicament. \n   It begs the question: is he the only VC in Australia to receive a bonus for exposing his university to financial and reputational risk by actively seeking dependence on the Chinese student market?\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.39am BST \n \n \n  2.53am BST  \n Western Australia reports no new Covid-19 cases \n  \n  Western Australia has no new cases of Covid to report in the last 24 hours. \n  There are only six active cases in the state, although there is still one person in the ICU. \n  \n Updated at 3.44am BST \n \n \n  2.30am BST  \n  \n  I\u2019ve confirmed that Senator Jacqui Lambie will be voting with Labor and the Greens to restore the consultation period for pay cuts back to one week (up from 24 hours under new government rules). \n  Lambie has discussed with Labor the disallowance to extend jobkeeper to more universities and foreign government-owned businesses, such as the airline catering company, Dnata.  \n  She has concerns about job losses but hasn\u2019t arrived at a final position.  \n  A vote is expected at 6pm, although Centre Alliance and One Nation are the critical votes on that. \n  The Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, is urging a vote for the disallowance: \n   \n   Dnata workers are ringing their federal MPs and senators urging them to support this motion because their families depend on it. We have workers who are struggling to pay bills, struggling to get medical supplies for their kids, eating whatever tinned food they have in their house to avoid buying groceries. They have been weeks without pay now and many fear they won\u2019t even qualify for jobseeker.

University employees are also excluded from the jobkeeper program. \n   \n   \n   Under the deal: \n   \n   \n   No university employee will be involuntarily stood down without pay. \n   On a temporary basis of one year, some staff at deeply affected universities will receive 85 per cent of their salary. The vast majority of affected staff will receive between 90 and 95 per cent of their former salary. People on lower wages will not be affected. \n   Temporary salary reductions will only happen after non-staff costs and management salaries have been reduced. \n   Non-wage conditions such as superannuation and leave continue to accrue at the standard rate. \n   Displaced casual and fixed-term staff will be prioritised for new work. \n   Redundancies will only happen in cases where a university can explicitly prove there is no work. \n   \n   \n   NTEU president, Alison Barnes, said: \u201cThere are no perfect options in a crisis. In the absence of a properly funded federal crisis package our Union has intervened to put income security and fairness at the centre of a national response. \n   \n   \n   \u201cWithout this agreement, we faced mass sackings which would have seen careers derailed and livelihoods destroyed.\u201d \n   \n  The deal will still have to be voted on by workers, and the NTEU dealing with management is very controversial in the sector. \n  \n Updated at 2.50am BST \n \n \n  2.10am BST  \n  \n  A couple more bills to keep an eye on. \n  This one from Peter Dutton. \n   \n   \n    Minister for Home Affairs @PeterDutton_MP introduced Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Bill 2020 https://t.co/4Qth8vA3cX #auspol\u2014 Political Alert (@political_alert) May 13, 2020\n    \n   \n  And the payment reporting time bill from Karen Andrews, which is designed to: \n   \n   The Payment Times Reporting Bill (the Bill) introduces a new Payment Times Reporting Scheme (the Scheme) which requires large businesses and large government enterprises with an annual total income of over $100 million to publicly report on their payment terms and practices for their small business suppliers. In identifying small business suppliers, the Scheme will draw on a taxation legislation definition of small business as those entities with an annual turnover of less than $10 million.  \n   The objective of the Scheme is to improve payment outcomes for small businesses by creating transparency around the payment practices of large business entities. By providing access to information on large business payment performance, small businesses will be able to make a more informed decision about their potential customers. Greater transparency on payment practices and performance will also create pressure for cultural change to improve payment times. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.50am BST \n \n \n  2.05am BST  \n  \n  A federal court judge says he will make orders allowing Virgin Australia to start giving \u201cconditional credits\u201d for cancelled flights. \n  But at a hearing this morning John Middleton stopped short of allowing administrators of the largely grounded airline to avoid large swathes of the liabilities they\u2019re running up while in charge of the company after the attorney general and the Taxation Office asked for more time to consider the issue. \n  As Guardian Australia reported, Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators stopped giving refunds and flight credits for cancelled trips after they took control of the airline. \n  The administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, did this because otherwise they faced being personally liable for the money. \n  But they\u2019ve told the court the move put them at a competitive disadvantage.  \n  The proposal Middleton said he would approve will allow the administrators to offer flight credits but not cash refunds. \n  Meanwhile, the Attorney General\u2019s Department and the ATO have been given until Friday to decide if they object to other orders proposed by the administrators. \n  The AG\u2019s department wanted the time to think about the administrators\u2019 desire to disclaim personal responsibility for jobkeeper payments, while the issue for the ATO appears to relate to inter-company loans. \n  \n Updated at 2.52am BST \n \n \n  1.50am BST  \n  \n  An editorial in China\u2019s state-backed English-language paper, Global Times, has sounded a warning to Australia, saying import suspensions and potential tariffs are not necessarily punishment but should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. \n  The editorial says Australia\u2019s support for an inquiry into the source and origin of the virus has worsened a relationship already damaged by Australia\u2019s \u201cunfriendly actions\u201d towards China, including the blocking of Huawei from the 5G network. \n  And if Australia is feeling worried about Chinese retaliation?  \n  Well, it should. \n  \u201cThe latest meat import suspension and the possible imposition of major tariffs on Australia\u2019s barley exports don\u2019t necessarily represent China\u2019s economic punishment for Australia, though they may serve as a wake-up call for Australia to reflect on its economic links with China,\u201d it says. \n  \u201cWhile China is the only choice for Australia\u2019s massive commodity exports, Australia is not necessarily the only option for China.\u201d \n  It also notes, just out of interest, that China could replace Australian meat imports with supplies from the US, the very country Australia has sided with. \n  \u201cOf course, China\u2019s willingness to maintain a cooperative relationship with Australia hasn\u2019t changed, and it is now up to Australia to decide what to do next.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.54am BST \n \n \n  1.48am BST  \n  \n  Paul Karp tells me the disallowance motion, which Labor, supported by the Greens, are putting forward to extend jobkeeper, is expected to be put to the Senate about 6pm. \n  Pauline Hanson\u2019s two votes are enough to block it, if she is not on board. And suddenly, the government has a bill which she has been hankering for rushing through the parliament. \n  \n Updated at 2.54am BST \n \n \n  1.41am BST  \n  \n  What else have we learned in the Covid hearing this morning? \n  The secretary of PM&amp;C, Phil Gaetjens, doesn\u2019t have a lot of answers over how national cabinet works in association with the usual cabinet. \n  So he couldn\u2019t answer whether or not the cabinet cabinet has to endorse the decisions by the national cabinet. He also couldn\u2019t answer whether or not there was a handbook to guide national cabinet proceedings (a standard in the public service), and referred to the cabinet handbook, which wouldn\u2019t mention the national cabinet, because as we keep hearing, we haven\u2019t seen this level of cooperation in the federation before. \n  He told the committee to look at the PM&amp;C website. Which also doesn\u2019t seem to have the answers.  \n  Obviously, this is, using the word of 2020, \u201cunprecedented\u201d \u2013 but it is not as though Gaetjens didn\u2019t know he was appearing in front of this committee today. \n  \n Updated at 2.55am BST \n \n \n  1.30am BST  \n  \n  Brendan Murphy also just told the committee that he would be surprised if \u201cthe true international caseload isn\u2019t closer to the 20m mark\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 2.55am BST \n \n \n  1.24am BST  \n  \n  This is a little bit strange. \n  David Littleproud just introduced this bill into the House \u2013 Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020 \u2013 which would make it easier for Australian companies to export medical cannabis. \n  That would be particularly good news for Queensland, which is building up quite the industry in that sector. \n  So normal so far. \n  It gets weird with the timing \u2013 despite introducing it today, Littleproud wants the parliament to be dealt with today. So the government wants it rushed through the parliament on the same day it is introduced, which is usually only reserved for emergency bills, or fixing messes. \n  This is not that. \n  But it is something that Pauline Hanson has been chasing for quite some time. And the government needs Hanson to vote to against extending jobkeeper to universities, extending jobkeeper to foreign government-owned companies with local workers and restoring the one-week consultation period for pay cuts. \n  Deidre Chambers! \n  \n Updated at 2.57am BST \n \n \n  1.19am BST  \n Chief medical officer warns border restrictions will be in place for some time \n  \n  Victorians may be enjoying a few more freedoms today, and other states and territories have seen a slight relaxation of the restriction rules \u2013 but don\u2019t expect travel to return to normal any time soon. \n  Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, was asked about the border closures in the Senate select committee hearing this morning and replied: \n   \n   I cannot see border measures materially changing for some time and that presents a huge problem for the nation. \n   \n  Australia is still seeing new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed each week from returned travellers, who are still being sent into forced quarantine.  \n  \n Updated at 2.58am BST \n \n \n  1.04am BST  \n  \n  The Greens have advised me that they support Labor\u2019s attempt to extend jobkeeper to foreign government-owned companies with local workers, like the airline catering company Dnata. \n  Labor and the Greens need four out of five crossbench votes for that motion and a bid to improve universities\u2019 ability to access the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy. They\u2019re lobbying the crossbench this morning. \n  There is further movement on the consultation period for employers seeking cuts to conditions in workplace pay deals. \n  Centre Alliance\u2019s Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia that 24 hours is \u201cnot enough\u201d but the party is \u201csupportive of something closer to the three-day mark\u201d.  \n  That\u2019s a new compromise, the rules now say 24 hours and Labor and the Greens are trying to restore a period of one week. \n  Griff also said there was \u201csome merit\u201d in One Nation\u2019s proposal that emergency cuts should only last for 12 months. \n  \n Updated at 2.59am BST \n \n \n  12.59am BST  \n  \n  The backbench has found its groove. \n   \n   \n    Nationals MP George Christensen accuses China of bullying and coercion. \"I'm very worried about what China is doing at the moment, they're harming our primary industries, it's all a bullying and coercive exercise and it shouldn't go on\" @SBSNews #auspol \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa pic.twitter.com/Y2jenN7Asv\u2014 Pablo Vi\u00f1ales (@pablovinales) May 12, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.59am BST \n \n \n  12.58am BST  \n  \n  Insert jokes here. \n   \n   \n    Premier announcing 3 thousand litres of free beer going to the outback pubs and clubs .

Kawasaki disease can be set off by other viral infections \u2026 \n   We think that it\u2019s it\u2019s one of those rare things that is emerged because of this the huge burden of the infected load. In those countries, it may appear in other countries with large, very large volumes of infected people, but because it\u2019s so rare, it\u2019s unlikely to be seen in Australia.

Our people have continued to serve our customers diligently and professionally under challenging circumstances. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.09am BST \n \n \n  11.53pm BST  \n  \n  The Global Times newspaper tends to be the more shouty and hawkish of the Communist party of China-run state media. \n  So when it has an editorial slamming a particular country or action, it\u2019s essentially treated as an angry diplomatic cable.  \n  It turned that attention to Australia in its latest editorial, warning of economic consequences if relations continue to deteriorate:  \n   \n   Australian media outlets have shown great concern over the likelihood that China may soon impose major tariffs on barley exports from Australia, as the move could become the symbolic start to a series of retaliatory measures against the country. \n   Some Australian media have deliberately politicized the issue, describing it as China\u2019s retaliation to Australia\u2019s attempt to blame China for the pandemic by calling for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. However, the fact is that the decision on Chinese tariffs will be based on an anti-dumping investigation into Australia\u2019s exported barley that has been ongoing for almost 18 months. \n   If anything, Australia\u2019s worries over potential tariffs underline the anxiety surrounding deteriorating China-Australia relations. Since China-US relations hit their lowest point in decades amid the Covid-19 crisis, relations between China and Australia have been heading in the same direction. Australian politicians have made no secret of their desire to follow the US, joining in on the China blame game. If China-US ties continue to deteriorate, the uncertainty surrounding China-Australia relations will also increase. \n   Such uncertainty will inevitably lead to economic repercussions. In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese people and companies to watch out for potential risks when it comes to doing business with or studying in Australia. \n   Fundamentally speaking, it is not in the interests of people in China and Australia if the latter\u2019s politicians continue to take unfriendly actions and launch political attacks on the former. China-US relations are now in trouble, and if Australia chooses to follow, that would not only negatively impact its relations with China but would also come at the cost of its own economy and trade. \n   In fact, the importance of China to Australia\u2019s economy may be far greater than some Australian politicians estimate. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination, with exports to China accounting for about one third of its total exports. China is the main buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, farm products and education services. \n   There is a need for Australia to reposition its role in regional geopolitics rather than becoming the lapdog of the US. It needs to rethink its relationships with the US and China at this juncture. Given its economic ties with Asian countries are closer than those it has with western nations, it may be more in its interests to focus on how to further integrate into the Asian industrial chain. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.11am BST \n \n \n  11.44pm BST  \n  \n  Amid all this, the Eden-Monaro byelection is still to be scheduled. \n  Labor isn\u2019t messing around \u2013 Anthony Albanese will be out there this morning, with the party\u2019s candidate, Kristy McBain, and Catherine King for a doorstop at Murrumbateman. \n  But then Labor can do that \u2013 it has a candidate.

That\u2019s the number to watch \u2013 the community transmissions. \n  \n Updated at 12.36am BST \n \n \n  11.07pm BST  \n  \n  But the NSW premier says she expects the number of new Covid-19 cases will increase as restrictions are relaxed. \n   \n   The number of patients in intensive care is very low with Covid but we know once we ease restrictions it won\u2019t be the case.  \n   But if you look around the world, many communities who are easing restrictions aren\u2019t in the position NSW is in.  \n   Many communities around the world easing restrictions still have the case numbers in the hundreds every day, which would be untenable for us, which means thousands of people would have been in ICUs and an untenable situation.  \n   We should feel very fortunate we are in a position as we ease restrictions, to have the case numbers, it gives us options but it also means we have to maintain our vigilance and get tested if we have the mildest symptoms and stay home if we worry we have been in contact with somebody.  \n   I can\u2019t stress enough, when you are with people you know very well, even outdoors, you tend to forget to socially distance.  \n   We can\u2019t let it happen. Inside a household it is fine, but outside, with the people you live with, even if they are members of your extended family or very close friends, don\u2019t think you can\u2019t pass the virus to each other.

It is something we are incredibly proud of, something we need to maintain. I always say to our experts and my team here in NSW, there is no way we can\u2019t lead the world in the way we deal with the pandemic moving forward, and give good advice to our citizens to keep us safe and look at parts of our community, parts of business in particular that we can activate without having any adverse impacts on health.  \n   We know from Friday we will analyse the data closely because we appreciate once you ease any restriction, there is more activities and a chance of people getting the virus or passing it on to others. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.38am BST \n \n \n  11.00pm BST  \n  \n  Parliament is also ticking over, although there is still no word on what the revised sitting schedule will look like. \n  Budget estimates was scheduled from 25 May but it is a little hard to have budget estimates without a budget.

In a tweet on Sunday night, the theatre said they had \u201cno reason to disagree with current scientific and government advice on coping with coronavirus\u201d but explained that \u201cit is becoming increasingly impractical to sustain business as usual\u201d. All other upcoming Old Vic productions, including 4000 Miles starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, remain scheduled to go ahead. \n  The Arcola in east London announced that it is suspending all public performances until further notice and said the impact of Covid-19 is a critical threat \u201cto the livelihoods of all those who work in the arts\u201d. On Twitter, the theatre announced \u201cwe do not believe that it is practical or responsible for us to stage shows while people\u2019s lives are at risk\u201d. The Arcola explained that the majority of its income comes from theatregoers and called for donations to ensure that it \u201cstays thriving, long after this crisis is past\u201d. \n  The Turbine theatre, which opened at Battersea Power Station last summer, has cancelled all performances until 18 April. The Bunker, which is housed in a former underground car park in London Bridge, has cancelled a week of performances which featured almost 100 artists and was due to start on Monday. \u201cThis is not a decision taken lightly,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have spent months organising this week; at the last count we had 94 people involved in our week and to have to cancel the day before we begin is soul destroying. But we have to put our artists\u2019 safety first.\u201d \n  On Saturday, the Young Vic cancelled two performances of Nora: A Doll\u2019s House due to a member of the company self-isolating as a precaution. The Young Vic said it would make a further announcement about the show on Monday morning. \n  Major theatres in Ireland, France, Germany and Italy \u2013 as well as New York\u2019s Broadway \u2013 have been closed since last week. \n  \n Updated at 11.39pm GMT \n \n \n  11.20pm GMT  \n  \n  Reporter Joe Parkin Daniels has this from Bogota, Colombia: \n  Venezuela has announced a \u201ccollective quarantine\u201d, after cases of Covid-19 in the troubled South American nation jumped to 17 on Sunday evening. \n  \u201cThere is no other option,\u201d president Nicolas Maduro said in a televised statement. \u201cWe either go into quarantine or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country.\u201d \n  Maduro ordered the quarantine in six states and the capital Caracas, though said that transport, health and food delivery would continue. \n  Venezuela - which boasts the largest proven oil reserves on the planet - is already mired in social and economic turmoil, with shortages in basic goods and medical supplies widespread and runaway hyperinflation.  \n  Public health experts warn that the country is far from ready to handle any outbreak amid an already collapsing health system.  \n  Colombia, which neighbours Venezuela to the west, closed its border on Saturday, worried that the former could become the epicentre of an outbreak in South America. \n  Colombia, which has 34 cases of Covid-19, has also announced strict measures. On Sunday evening president Ivan Duque announced that schools would be closed from Monday on, adding to a ban on foreign visitors announced earlier on Sunday. \n  \n \n \n  11.07pm GMT  \n  \n  London\u2019s French Lyc\u00e9e and its satellite schools have decided to close from Monday following concerns from parents. \n  The decision affects over 4,000 children in South Kensington and other locations.  \n  In a statement, the school said: \u201cThis is a difficult decision. Rest assured that we will monitor its impact on each family and remain at your disposal to answer questions and support you.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  11.03pm GMT  \n  \n  Serbia has introduced a state of emergency to halt the spread of coronavirus, president Aleksandar Vucic said on Sunday after meeting top government and health officials in Belgrade. \n  Vucic said he was acting in line with legal provisions that allow him to declare a state of emergency in the absence of a sitting parliament, which was disbanded ahead of April 26 general elections. \n  \u201cFrom this very moment we have a state of emergency,\u201d Vucic said in a televised address, adding that the government will formulate the \u201charshest measures\u201d soon. \n  He said that the fight \u201cagainst an invisible adversary\u201d will be aimed at the protection of the elderly, who are particularly at risk from the outbreak. \n  Vucic said kindergartens, schools and universities will be closed until the end of the semester. \n  Health authorities in the Balkan country have so far reported 46 cases of infection and tested 283 people. There have been no fatalities, but two patients are in a serious condition. \n  Vucic warned that from Monday the military will be guarding hospitals, while police will be monitoring those quarantined or in self-isolation for 14 or 28 days. Those who violate quarantine may face jail terms of up to three years, he said. \n  \n \n \n  11.02pm GMT  \n  \n  The Czech Republic tightened restrictions on Sunday to combat the new coronavirus outbreak, banning people from moving around except for work, essential shopping and other necessary activities until 24 March. \n  Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the new measures would take effect from midnight, adding the government recommended that those who can work from home or take holidays. \n  The country of 10.7 million has confirmed 253 cases of the virus with no deaths reported so far. \n  The restrictions come a day after the government closed most shops and restaurants for at least 10 days. Other measures include a ban on nearly all international travel from Monday, and closing schools. \n  \n \n \n  11.00pm GMT  \n  \n  The University of Nottingham will move all teaching online from 23 March in response to the coronavirus outbreak. \n  The east Midlands university asked its students to remain calm and said:  \n   \n   The University is following the latest advice for the UK from the Department for Health and Social Care, Public Health England and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - as well as from the Chinese health authorities for our Ningbo campus. \n   Nonetheless, we are now treating w/c Monday 16 March as a transition period to accelerate our plans to deliver all teaching online from Monday 23 March. This means there will be no face-to-face lectures, seminars or tutorials from Monday 23 March. \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.54pm GMT  \n  \n  Reporter Patrick Greenfield has this from Costa Rica: \n  The Costa Rican health ministry has announced that there are now 35 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Central American country. \n  Of those cases, 30 are Costa Rican nationals and 5 are foreigners ranging from 10 to 87 years old. According to the update, 450 people have tested negative for the virus.  \n   \n   \n    No compartamos rumores.La informaci\u00f3n oficial la encuentran ac\u00e1.Hoy es el d\u00eda que m\u00e1s casos hemos confirmado.

Preliminary investigation has indicated that all three had travel connections\u2014two recently traveled to the Philippines and the third had a family member who recently returned from Japan.The Guam department of public health and social services was working to identify people who had been in close contact with the three people over the last 14 days. \n  Guam also declared a state of emergency, including a 14-day suspension of non-essential government operations, school closures, closure of senior citizen centres and self-isolation for people returning from travel. \n  The announcement follows the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the Pacific region last week, when French Polynesia announced that a politician, Maina Sage, had been diagnosed with the virus. \n  Sage had recently travelled to Paris and had met with France\u2019s culture minister, who has since been diagnosed with Covid-19. \n  Regional organisations and Pacific governments are preparing for more cases of Covid-19 in the islands region. Many citizens in small island developing states are fearful of the potential stress on medical services. \n  An epidemic of measles across the Pacific last year highlighted the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, adding to existing burdens on public health systems from non-communicable diseases. \n  \n Updated at 10.44pm GMT \n \n \n  10.35pm GMT  \n  \n  The leader of one of England\u2019s leading school chains has broken ranks and called for this summer\u2019s A-levels and GCSE exams to be scraped until 2021, and for students to repeat the whole school year if necessary. \n  Hamid Patel of the Blackburn-based Star Academies trust says the UK government needs to immediately announce that exams are off the table: \n   \n   Covid-19 is a once-in-a-century pandemic and it requires once-in-a-century responses and solutions to reduce casualties. They may not be the only solutions, but need serious consideration by parliament if we are to avoid students and staff putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk because of the allure of high grades or a prestigious university place. \n   \n  Read the full story here. \n  \n \n \n  10.33pm GMT  \n  \n  In New Zealand border restrictions went into place at 1am on Monday morning, with all arrivals to the country - including New Zealand citizens, having to self-isolate. \n  Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the government had enforcement powers for self-isolation which it would enact if anyone proved reluctant. Anyone arriving from the Pacific Islands is exempt from the restrictions. \n  Meanwhile the country\u2019s national airline carrier Air New Zealand is slashing 85% of its international flights in the next few months, and has placed itself in a trading halt. \n  Around the country more than 8,000 people are in self-isolation, including three government MPs. Later this week restrictions on mass gatherings are expected to be announced, as well as a financial stimulus package in the billions. \n  \n \n \n  10.28pm GMT  \n  \n  Our legal affairs correspondent Owen Bowcott has this from Northern Ireland: \n  Lawyers acting for the mother of a child who has asthma and attends a primary school in County Armagh are planning to launch a judicial review of the Stormont government\u2019s decision not to close schools in Northern Ireland. \n  Darragh Mackin, a solicitor at Phoenix Law, said that the girl suffers underlying health problems, including severe asthma and is at a greater risk of harm should she contract the coronavirus.  \n  He added: \u201cIt is clear that the respective public bodies have each failed in their respective obligations to our client, and indeed all children, by continuing to require their attendance at school in circumstances in which they would be at an increased risk of contracting the condition.  \n  There is no time for any further delay. The necessary policies and decisions all need to be taken in a manner that recognises the real and immediate risk.  \n  \u201cThe wider international community has spoken. Their advice cannot and should not be ignored.  \n  \u201cIt is a deplorable situation when a mother has to initiate urgent legal proceedings to ensure that her child, and indeed children across the jurisdiction, are afforded the necessary protections and safeguards required under law.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  10.25pm GMT  \n  \n  Sam Gelder here.

If it is the last question it is about economic efforts to combat damage from the outbreak and whether enough has been done. \n  Pence says the administration strongly supports the House legislation passed on Saturday and \u201cno American worker should worry about missing a pay cheque if they\u2019re feeling ill.\u201d There are of course gaps and worries and competing corporate interests which will affect the extension of paid leave which the House bill provides. \n  On the economy as a whole, Pence says \u201cwe\u2019re in just the first few innings of this effort\u201d but vital industries will be supported. It\u2019s vague \u2013 of course it is. \n  There will be a morning briefing on Monday, Pence says, and a health briefing in the afternoon, and he appeals for Americans to keep up hygiene best practices. He salutes the task force members too, of course. \n  And we\u2019re out, with a few shouted questions following Pence out of the door. \n  \n \n \n  10.11pm GMT  \n  \n  Pence is back up, and asked about the testing process and the work with tech companies including Google and that vexed issue of the diagnostic website. \n  \u201cAt some point early in the week there will be a website that goes up,\u201d Pence says, where people can fill out a questionnaire to see if they might have coronavirus. \n  Adm Brett Giroir, assistant health secretary, describes the aims of the website project and the testing.  \n  There will be approximately 1.9m tests rolled out to laboratories this week, he says. There\u2019s no precise timeline but it\u2019s an \u201cabsolute priority\u201d, he says. \n  \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that the lab testing issue is over,\u201d he says, but the focus will now be how to get people actually tested. \n  \n \n \n  10.06pm GMT  \n  \n  Pence is asked about possible shortages of hospital beds and ventilators and how the White House is planning to stop Americans \u201cdying\u201d and \u201csuffocating\u201d. He says he\u2019ll call on health secretary Alex Azar but pauses first to praise the public-private partnership again. \n  Here\u2019s former labor secretary Robert Reich on that subject: \n   \n    Related: America has no real public health system \u2013 coronavirus has a clear run | Robert Reich  \n   \n  Azar starts by praising the people on the podium behind him, then says any pandemic \u201cruns the risk of exceeding our healthcare capacity\u201d. Which seems obvious. He goes on to outline stockpiling and procedural preparations without mentioning many actual numbers. \n  \u201cWe have tremendous supplies but we want to acquire more,\u201d he says, adding that for national security purposes he will not disclose \u201cconcrete numbers\u201d of things like, yes, ventilators. A recent Johns Hopkins study suggested the national stock of those was nowhere near enough to cope with what may be coming. \n  \n \n \n  10.01pm GMT  \n  \n  Now we\u2019re on to social distancing \u2013 and whether a national lockdown might be on the way while the president tells Americans to \u201crelax\u201d. \n  Pence hails Trump\u2019s \u201cdecisive leadership early on\u201d, to do with travel restrictions on China and now Europe, the UK and Ireland. Of course he does. \n  He calls on Dr Fauci, who says he meant what he said on the shows this morning about the need for social distancing to be strictly enforced and followed. \u201cAnything and everything we\u2019ll consider.\u201d \n  He is asked for examples. \n  No bars or restaurants? \u201cCould be, could be.\u201d \n  He wants the press to let the new guidelines come out tomorrow, then ask questions. \n  \n \n \n  9.58pm GMT  \n  \n  Pence is asked about bar and restaurant closings and whether he expects them to spread nationwide, and about the airport customs delays on Saturday night. \n  There will be updated federal guidelines tomorrow, Pence says, but they will defer to state and local authorities. \n  He asks the acting homeland security secretary to address the screening problems at major airports which caused huge queues and no social distancing whatsoever on Saturday night and led Governor Pritzker to say the administration had to \u201cget its shit together\u201d. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus: governor tells Trump to 'get shit together' amid airport chaos  \n   \n  Chad Wolf, the acting secretary, says the lines were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and 12 airports saw adjustments to practice but O\u2019Hare in Chicago did not. Average wait time for screening is now 30 minutes he says, adding that the the process is \u201cfixed\u201d. \n  Asked if domestic air travel could be shut down, Wolf says all options are on the table. \n  \n \n \n  9.53pm GMT  \n  \n  Dr Anthony Fauci says the \u201ctesting space available\u201d is \u201centering into a new phase\u201d \u2013 successive members of the task force are stressing that the administration is doing better on that front, as they would of course be expected to do. \n  \u201cThe worst is ahead for us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s how we respond that is going to determine how that endpoint is going to be.\u201d \n  Now questions. \n  \n \n \n  9.51pm GMT  \n  \n  Dr Deborah Birx is up now, explaining how lab work is done in the US and how the US is \u201cgoing to see a spike in the curve\u201d as more testing is done and more cases of coronavirus are found. \n  Schools in New York City, meanwhile, were being kept open in part because of the vital social role they play for poorer families, providing full meals and childcare while parents work tough and necessary jobs. That support will still be needed now the schools are closed. \n  Mayor Bill de Blasio, who faced a horrible quandary over the schools which it seems Governor Andrew Cuomo has now solved for him, has announced that there are now five deaths related to coronavirus in the city and 329 confirmed cases. The \u201cnumber of confirmed cases is moving rapidly\u201d, though, he says.  \n  \n \n \n  9.45pm GMT  \n  \n  At the White House they\u2019re on to task force members describing their work. One would expect the fireworks to start when or if Vice-President Pence takes questions, although they might be smaller rockets and Catherine wheels given his boss has left the room. \n  In New York, it\u2019s being reported that the public schools have at last been closed, until 20 April at least.  \n   \n   \n    BREAKING: NYC mayor closes public schools until at least April 20. https://t.co/M9BPoVRDGe\u2014 Dan Linden (@DanLinden) March 15, 2020\n    \n   \n  Parents of students in the biggest such system in the US now have a major problem on their hands as they themselves are forced to work at home.

The state of California has only 11,500 beds in adult and pediatric intensive care units, and only 7,587 ventilators currently in hospitals, Newsom said. \n   These policies, including the closure of all California bars, nightclubs, and wineries, are official guidance, not orders, Newsom said.  \n   \u201cI have every expectation that guidelines will be followed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the capacity to enforce if necessary.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.36pm GMT  \n  \n  Pence goes on, heralding what he calls an \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented national public-private partnership for diagnostic testing\u201d. He would say that, of course, but he also praises the bipartisan passage of relief measures by the House on Saturday.  \n  Then he says, \u201cAs the president often says, we are all in this together.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  9.33pm GMT  \n  \n  The US now has more than 2,900 cases in 49 states, Vice-President Mike Pence says as he takes the podium. \n  The risk of serious illness remains low, Pence says, but because the risk is related to the most vulnerable, the administration will continue to urge every American to be vigilant in practising good hygiene and heeding official advice. \n  Pence says he has spoken to Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois, who had harsh words for the administration last night and this morning. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus: governor tells Trump to 'get shit together' amid airport chaos  \n   \n  Pence riffs extensively about the national day of prayer Trump declared for today, and repeats Trump\u2019s words about his call with the grocery store executives \u2013 which will stay open, he says, if possibly with reduced hours. \n  The president and Pence will brief all the governors tomorrow, the VP says \u2013 \u201cspecifically about our expanding testing to the American people\u201d. The lack of testing capability has been a key part of criticism of the administration\u2019s response. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus: Trump's stumbles and testing failures pave way to disaster, experts say  \n   \n  Pence says testing is now available in all 50 states and claims \u201cunprecedented speed\u201d in the development of coronavirus testing.

On the subject, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was on the shows this morning, batting away questions about whether the administration is worried about a coronavirus-enhanced recession. \n   \n    Related: Trump aide Mnuchin: US does not face recession though shutdowns mount  \n   \n  He also thanks Google for \u201csubstantiating what I said on Friday\u201d about a website for self-diagnosis of Covid-19, which the press said was inaccurate. Trump claims he was right all along but it still seems Google, or a company related to it, is actually testing its website in the Bay Area of California and not rolling it out nationally. \n  The president also reels off a list of CEOs of grocery and supply chain companies who he spoke to today, about public panic-buying and how to avoid it. \n  \n \n \n  9.17pm GMT  \n  \n  Here comes Donald Trump. \n  \n \n \n  9.15pm GMT  \n  \n  Speaking of which: \n   \n   \n    California governor Gavin Newsom announces that the state's bars, nightclubs, breweries and wineries be closed.\u2014 Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) March 15, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.13pm GMT  \n  \n  As the briefing gets going and Mike Pence likely seeks to offer reassuring words, it\u2019s worth considering that Dr Anthony Fauci, a very senior Trump administration official, said on CNN this morning that \u201cYes, it is possible\u201d thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans could die as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. \n  Here\u2019s more of Fauci: \n   \n   Our job, our challenge is to try and make that not happen. But to think, if we go about our daily lives and not worry about everything, that it\u2019s not going to happen, it could happen. And it could be worse. To me, that\u2019s a real impetus to take very seriously the kinds of things \u2013 I might make a point that people sometimes think that you\u2019re overreacting. I like it when people are thinking, I\u2019m overreacting, because that means we\u2019re doing it just right. \n   \n  Fauci told various morning shows he was in favour of more strict restrictions on social gatherings such as those adopted in Ohio and elsewhere, where bars and restaurants are being closed. \n  It\u2019s breaking elsewhere that New York governor Andrew Cuomo wants New York City public schools closed this week. They are still open at the moment, unlike such systems in other big cities: \n   \n    Related: New York City teachers threaten mass \u2018sickout\u2019 as schools stay open amid coronavirus  \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.06pm GMT  \n  \n  Martin Pengelly here in New York, taking over to cover an imminent White House briefing from Vice-President Mike Pence and members of his coronavirus task force. \n  It\u2019s probably worth pointing out while we wait for the presser to start that the James S Brady Briefing Room, where it will be held, is notoriously not very roomy and thus entirely unsuited to social distancing. When full, the press practically sit in each other\u2019s laps. \n  Before yesterday\u2019s briefing members of the press had their temperatures taken and one was turned away. That was the briefing at which Donald Trump revealed that he had taken a coronavirus test, which was later reported to have been negative. \n  There have been a lot of reports about how often Trump and other officials including Dr Anthony Fauci, a top public health official, have touched their faces and shaken hands with each other during recent briefings.

Woolworths will open its doors exclusively to the elderly and people with disabilities for a dedicated shopping hour, after panic buying due to the coronavirus stripped shelves of essentials items. \n  Most of its supermarkets across the nation will open to the vulnerable only from 7am to 8am, beginning on Tuesday. \n  Panic buying in recent weeks sparked by the spread of Covid-19 in Australia has seen supermarkets stripped of toilet paper, pasta and tinned and other dried goods. \n  \u201cThe move has been prompted by the unprecedented demand in supermarkets over the past week, which has seen many elderly and vulnerable people in the community missing out on vital items they may need when they shop,\u201d Woolworths announced on Monday. \n  The managing director, Claire Peters, said despite the retailer\u2019s attempts to quickly restock shelves, many elderly customers had continued to miss out. \n  \u201cThis temporary measure will give them, and those with a disability, the opportunity to shop before our stores officially open - helping them obtain the essential items they need most in a less crowded environment,\u201d Peters said. \n  Access will be granted if the shopper has a relevant government issued concession card.All other shoppers will be granted access after 8am. \n  \u201cNow - more than ever - we need to be kind to each other,\u201d Peters said. \n  \n \n \n  8.11pm GMT  \n  \n  Six care home residents in Scotland have been diagnosed with coronavirus. \n  Highgate Care Home in North Lanarkshire said it had put in place \u201cstrict infection control measures\u201d after it identified the positive cases of Covid-19. \n  Staff, residents and their families are being informed. \n  John Kirk, managing director of the care home, said: \u201cThe health, safety and wellbeing of our residents and colleagues is of paramount importance.

The number infected rose by 2,000 new cases to 7,753. \n  \n \n \n  7.47pm GMT  \n  \n  Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro took selfies with supporters and celebrated the thousands of protestors gathering in major cities on Sunday, just days after he had called for a suspension of the demonstrations due to the spreading coronavirus. \n  Bolsonaro appeared to shrug off the advice of medical experts suggesting he remain isolated after several members of his delegation to Florida recently tested positive for the virus. \n  Bolsonaro strode down the ramp of the presidential palace in a Brazilian football shirt and met a throng of his hardcore supporters at the front gate, where he bumped fists, grabbed cell phones to take pictures and leaned in for selfies with the crowd. \n  \u201cAlthough I suggested (a postponement), I can\u2019t order anything because this protest isn\u2019t mine,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \n  \n \n \n  7.34pm GMT  \n  \n  The White House on Sunday urged Americans against \u201choarding\u201d as thousands flocked to supermarkets to stock up on essentials, saying US supply chains were strong and leaders were working together to ensure food supplies are available. \n  President Donald Trump held a phone call with more than two dozen grocery store and supply chain executives from across the country, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. \n  \u201cThe president reminded the participants that this is an all-of-America approach and each of their stores and the stores they support can help Americans feel calm and safe when shelves are stocked with the items they need,\u201d Deere said. \n  \n Updated at 7.56pm GMT \n \n \n  7.28pm GMT  \n  \n  Luxembourg on Sunday followed its neighbours France and Belgium in closing bars and restaurants to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus epidemic. \n  Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said that, from midnight, bars and restaurants would be closed but grocery shops, pharmacies and other essential businesses could remain open. \n  He called on citizens to limit their movements to travelling to work, food shopping, medical appointments and visits to help the elderly. \n  The over-65s - who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 - were urged to stay at home to reduce the risk of infection. \n  \u201cThey must cancel their activities and limit what is not essential,\u201d Bettel said after an emergency meeting of his government. \n  Swimming pools, museums, sports centres, night clubs, libraries and cinemas are also to be closed to try to stop the transmission of the virus. \n  The tiny Grand Duchy has reported 77 cases of the virus and one death so far. \n  \n \n \n  7.24pm GMT  \n  \n  France\u2019s health minister said on Sunday that 120 people had now died from coronavirus in the country, up from 91 on Saturday. \n  Oliver Veran told France 2 television that the number of cases had risen to about 5,400, up from 4,449 on Saturday. \n  \n Updated at 8.06pm GMT \n \n \n  7.21pm GMT  \n  \n  Kate Connolly in Berlin reports that the German government has just given more information about its surprise decision to close Germany\u2019s borders with Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg. \n  Interior minister Horst Seehofer said in a press conference in Berlin, the main reason for doing so, from 8am on Monday morning, was to slow down the spread of the virus, which was proving to be \u201cfast and aggressive\u201d. \n  The decision was not, as had been widely reported earlier in the day, primarily due to fears that people were driving over the border into Germany and buying up large quantities of the provisions that have been in most demand, and which are cheaper in Germany than in neighbouring countries. \n  There has been concern that such behaviour was in danger of causing social unrest in Germany, as people fear they will be unable to access food and other essentials for daily life in the event of the virus escalating. \n  But today\u2019s decision, taken after consultation with Angela Merkel, the chancellor, and the leaders of Germany\u2019s L\u00e4nder, and announced only after discussions with the leaders of the affected countries, marked an unexpected u-turn in German policy. \n  For days, the health minister Jens Spahn, and Merkel, have separately insisted on several occasions that Germany had no intention of closing its borders, believing to do so would have little impact on the spread of coronavirus. \n  Seehofer said \u201cWe implicitly ask all citizens to stop undertaking any journeys that are not absolutely necessary.\u201d \n  He added: \u201cThe situation is very serious. We must and will react to it accordingly\u201d. \n  Some 5,813 people have so far been confirmed with coronavirus, according to figures on Sunday evening. \n  The ninth and 10th deaths of people in Germany were announced on Sunday. \n  The new rules would be enforced by border police, Seehofer said. Where there were personnel shortages, border crossings would be closed, he said. \n  German citizens and those with residency permits for Germany, will still have the right to return to Germany, and commuters who criss cross the border for work, will also be able to continue to do so, he said. \n  \n \n \n  7.14pm GMT  \n  \n  Pope Francis left Vatican City on Sunday to pray in one of Rome\u2019s cathedrals for victims of the coronavirus pandemic. \n  The 83-year-old pontiff first visited Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica and then walked \u201con foot, as if on a pilgrimage\u201d to the San Marcello al Corso church, the Vatican said in a statement. \n  The statement said Pope Francis selected the church because it holds a \u201cmiraculous crucifix which, in 1522, was carried in procession through the districts of the city\u201d to mark the end of the Great Plague. \n  The pope prayed for \u201cthe end of the pandemic that affects Italy and the world, imploring for the healing of the many sick, and remembering the many victims,\u201d the Vatican said. \n  \n \n \n  6.58pm GMT  \n  \n  Iraq has suspended all flights to and from Baghdad airport for a week as of Tuesday, the government said in a statement on Sunday. \n  The government imposed a curfew in the capital Baghdad over the same period earlier in the day. At least 110 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed so far in Iraq, and 10 people have died. \n  \n \n \n  6.56pm GMT  \n  \n  More on the news from South Africa from our Africa correspondent Jason Burke: \n  South Africa has declared a national disaster and introduced a series of drastic measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak in the country. \n  In a televised address on Sunday evening, president Cyril Ramaphosa told South Africans that the greatest danger lay in \u201cfear and ignorance\u201d. \n  \u201cNever before in the history of our democracy has South Africa faced such a severe situation,\u201d Ramaphosa said, as he announced a package of travel bans and additional support to health services. \n  The current total of cases in the country now stands at over 60, with internal transmission of the virus becoming more common. \n  A travel ban will be imposed on flights to and from Italy, Spain, Germany, UK, the US, South Korea, Iran and China from the 18th. \n  Any current visas will be cancelled, Ramaphosa said, and South Africans returning from high risk countries will be placed in self-quarantine \n  In addition, gatherings of more than 100 will be prohibited, schools shut from Wednesday until after Easter and South Africans asked not to travel by any means of public transport. This last measure \u2013 a request, not an order \u2013 will effectively immobilise the vast majority of the population who do not own a car. \n  Ramaphosa also described measures to ramp up medical provision \u2013 a major concern in a country with an under-resourced health service \u2013 and to protect business from the impact of the shutdown. Tourism is a major earner in South Africa, and significant numbers of jobs are likely to be lost. The flagging economy of South Africa is ill-placed to withstand further strain, with soaring unemployment, a weakening currency and key utilities crippled by debt. \n  \n \n \n  6.46pm GMT  \n  \n  Forty new confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.The new cases include 23 males and 17 females. \n  Twenty-five are associated with the east of the country, nine are associated with the west and six are associated with the south. \n  There are now 169 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic and there have been two deaths. \n  \n Updated at 6.50pm GMT \n \n \n  6.42pm GMT  \n  \n  South Africa is imposing a travel ban on foreign nationals from the worst affected countries, including Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK and China as of next Wednesday. \n  In an address to the nation, president Cyril Ramaphosa said South African citizens were being advised not to travel to any of those countries, and said any person who has done will be tested and put in self-isolation or quarantine. Any visitors who have been in one of the high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa. \n  Schools will also be closed from Wednesday. \n  \n Updated at 6.50pm GMT \n \n \n  6.35pm GMT  \n  \n  As well as the rise in the death toll from from 1,441 to 1,809 on Sunday, Italian authorities also confirmed the number of infected in the country has risen by 2,853 to 20,603.

The regional authorities compaed them to dust-cloths. \n  \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a national production of masks,\u201d the head of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, told the Sole24Ore newspaper. \n  Italy is running out of masks after the outbreak of the coronavirus. In the country\u2019s pharmacies, the Fp2 and Fp3 masks are practically impossible to find.  \n  Last week, the Guardian visited the open-air market, in Ballar\u00f2, in Palermo, where some street vendors had set up stalls selling packages containing 14 masks for five euros. From the photographs taken by the Guardian, it can be seen how the masks are the same as those the Civil Protection has provided to Lombardy doctors. \n  The police have already seized thousands of counterfeit masks in Italy, sold for tens of euros each. \n  \n Updated at 6.56pm GMT \n \n \n  5.55pm GMT  \n  \n  Five members of the playing squad and staff of La Liga club Valencia have tested positive for Covid-19, weeks after the team travelled to Milan for a Champions League match.  \n  Earlier in the day, Valencia and Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay became the first La Liga player to confirm that he has the virus. \n  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that I\u2019ve got off to the wrong start in 2020,\u201d Garay, 33, wrote on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve tested positive for the coronavirus. I feel very good and now I just have to listen to the health authorities and remain isolated.\u201d \n  The club said the four others who tested positive are in self-isolation and are in good health.  \n  Spain is the second hardest-hit country in Europe, after Italy, and went into a near lockdown on Saturday. All organised football in Spain has been postponed for at least two weeks in a bid to prevent further spread of the virus. \n  \n \n \n  5.52pm GMT  \n  \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tested negative for coronavirus, his office said in a statement on Sunday. \n  Netanyahu was asymptomatic before undergoing the precautionary test, which was also administered to officials working close to him. \n  \n \n \n  5.50pm GMT  \n  \n  The video you didn\u2019t know you needed.

The majority of the new patients have been linked to the recent religious gathering, which drew people from several countries two weeks ago. \n  Health officials in Malaysia said on Friday that they were working around the clock to conduct mass testing of attendees, while other governments in the region have also urged citizens who were present to monitor for symptoms and get tested. \n  In Brunei, 40 people who traveled to the event are now reported to have the virus, while five attendees in Singapore are also infected.

The number of infected people had reached 13,938, a rise of 1,209, a small drop on the size of the previous 24 hour increase.  \n  Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV that 4,590 of those infected had recovered. \n  The figures came as public authorities continued to disagree over measures to stem the flow of new cases. Some of the worst affected areas called for a quarantine of their cities, but the Mayor of Tehran said the measure was not practicable. He has advised all people aged over 60 to stay home, but he is not imposing a closure of shops or offices. Officials are relying on citizens to show self-restraint. \n  A claim by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Friday that they were set to clean the streets, roads and shops over the weekend did not materialise with large numbers still out in Tehran shopping and acting as normal. The army instead started screening drills in a small number of provinces.  \n  The President Hassan Rouhani said he opposed curfews, and also rejected plans for fines to be imposed on anyone found to be driving while infected. He said it would be a sufficient punishment to turn people back, and gave the go-ahead for roadside checks in 11 provinces. He also announced a three-month grace period for hard pressed businesses to pay tax, electricity, water and gas bills and banking loans. \n  The death toll remained concentrated with the most 251 dying in the capital Tehran, 84 in Qom city and 143 in Khorazan and 72 in Mazandaran province. The vast majority are aged over 60 or more. \n  On Saturday, cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiee denied all rumours about a lockdown in Tehran. \n  \n Updated at 2.48pm GMT \n \n \n  2.19pm GMT  \n  \n  Kate Connolly, our correspondent in Berlin reports that Germany is to close its borders to France, Switzerland and Austria, the government has just announced. \n  5,072 people were confirmed to have the coronavirus by early afternoon today, with the western state of North Rhine Westphalia, which borders the Netherlands and Belgium, the worst affected area with 2,100 cases. The ninth and 10th deaths from the virus in Germany were announced today. Last week, a German man died in Egypt from the virus. \n  German doctors have warned that they face a personnel shortage, which should be of far greater concern than the oft-cited potential lack of ventilators in case of a mass outbreak. Michael Pfeiffer, president of the German Respiratory Society (DGP), said intensive care wards were already understaffed. He urged decision-makers to train extra staff as a matter of urgency.  \n  Uwe Janssens, general secretary of the German Society for ICU Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), said the recommendations given by the Robert Koch Institute, the leading German public health advisory body, that every medical carer who has been in close, unprotected contact with confirmed coronavirus cases should self-isolate, was \u201cquite simply not practical\u201d. Janssens said it could lead to the collapse of Germany\u2019s health system. \n  In the southern state of Bavaria, which is the third worst affected state, with 681 confirmed cases, local elections are taking place today, despite coronavirus fears, with people advised to bring their own pens, and soap, water and disinfectant on hand for voting station staff. The number of people who chose to vote by postal vote in the last few days, is said to have been considerably higher than in previous years.  \n  As authorities ordered the closure of pubs and bars in Berlin, on top of the widespread closure of cultural venues, and all gatherings of 50 people or more, the city\u2019s police urged the public not to call emergency services if they spotted a venue that had yet to close. \u201cThe order is still very new and word still needs to get around,\u201d the police said in a tweet. \u201cThere is no need to ring our emergency number if you see pubs and bars which are still open.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.47pm GMT \n \n \n  2.10pm GMT  \n  \n  Gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned on the island of Montserrat. \n  The government also advised that all schools would be closed from 16 March-3 April, and hospital visits would be restricted until further notice. \n  The action curtailed St Patrick\u2019s Week festivities and saw other events cancelled. \n  The move came after a passenger on a flight from the UK to Antigua tested positive for Covid-19 and it transpired that more than 80 Montserrat-bound passengers had travelled on the same flight. The passengers have been advised to self-isolate. \n  There are no confirmed cases on the island. \n  \n Updated at 2.14pm GMT \n \n \n  2.04pm GMT  \n  \n  Georgia will temporarily shut its border with Russia for travellers from 16 March in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the government has said. \n  \u201cThis decision would not apply accordingly to the citizens of the Russian Federation and Georgia who wish to return to their home country,\u201d the government said on its website. Restrictions will not apply to freight traffic. \n  The ex-Soviet country of 3.7 million people has 30 cases of coronavirus, the highest number in the South Caucasus region. \n  Earlier this month, Georgia elections officials delayed the state\u2019s presidential primary set for 24 March until 19 May in an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic. \n  \n Updated at 2.15pm GMT \n \n \n  2.01pm GMT  \n  \n  Goldman Sachs Group Inc has confirmed to staff its first two cases of coronavirus, Bloomberg News reports, citing internal memos. \n  The investment bank informed its staff that an employee from its London office had tested positive and was at home in isolation, the report said. \n  The London case followed an earlier memo to staff in its Sydney office that an employee working in its Governor Phillip Tower site had a confirmed case of coronavirus, the report added. \n   \n   \n    Goldman Sachs has confirmed to staff the first cases of coronavirus as the Wall Street bank steps up plans to split up teams and allow more employees to work from home https://t.co/w2dg9ZhUSb\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) March 15, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.02pm GMT \n \n \n  1.47pm GMT  \n  \n  Hungary has confirmed its first death of the new coronavirus, state news agency MTI reported. \n  A 75 year-old Hungarian national died shortly after being hospitalised with severe pneumonia and a suspected coronavirus infection. \n  Hungary has 32 confirmed coronavirus cases and 159 people in quarantine, according to government data.

The total has reached 51, 13 more than yesterday.  \n  All \u2013 or almost all \u2013 appear to be individuals who have recently returned from travel to Europe or other badly hit places. This has been the pattern across most of the continent, where numbers of confirmed cases overall remain negligible compared to elsewhere. \n  Kenya, which has significant commercial ties with China and Europe, announced its first case late last week. However, the pandemic is still having a major effect.  \n  Among sporting events in South Africa that have been cancelled in recent days include the Two Oceans ultra marathon in Cape Town, which was set to take place early next month.  \n  There are widespread fears that weak and under-resourced health systems across the continent will have difficulty coping with large numbers of seriously ill people.

It\u2019s not isolation, it\u2019s asking them to reduce social contact. \n   We don\u2019t want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them. What were saying to them is, reduce your contact. \n   \n  The news of the potential isolation of elderly people was briefed anonymously to journalists overnight and has led to criticism over how the UK government is communicating policies and advice.  \n  Overnight anonymous briefings to Sunday journalists are common, but there have been calls for a new approach in light of the pandemic. \n  Asked about how the news emerged, Freeman said:  \n   \n   It\u2019s not how we would do it. Government\u2019s should be coming and explaining these things really clearly. \n   Overnight briefing, background briefing, unattributed sources is not the way to ensure that the public are understanding what we are trying to do and our working with us to do that. \n   \n   \n   \n    Giving clear and consistent information to public at the right time on #coronavirus is vital.

The same people who had assured us on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday that they would remain open, have now all closed,\u201d she said. \n  The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, announced that the country must \u201cclose all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops\u201d from midnight. \n  Although ski-resorts were not specifically listed, the ski industry in the UK believe they are all closing. \n  One of the biggest operators, Inghams, said \u201cas a responsible tour operator\u201d it would not be operating any more holidays to French resorts for the rest of the season and advised those who were due to go out on Sunday to abandon plans. \n  Palumbo said all those who had booked through an ATOL backed agent would get their money back but that small- to medium-sized tour operators and travel companies could go bust. \n  \u201cThe airlines are very quick to ask for help from the government but this is a massive flow of people which will costs the industry millions. If the government does not step in travel companies will start to fail because the cost of repatriation will be enormous,\u201d she said. \n  David Taylor, chief executive of Neilson holidays, said it was \u201chugely disappointed\u201d that it received such short notice on the closures. He called for emergency measures for the sector. \n   \n   With the Covid-19 crisis likely to last several months, we are asking the government to consider emergency measures specifically targeted at the travel and leisure sector to deliver immediate relief and help avoid widespread failures. \n   This remains an isolated issue on 2020 departures only and we are confident that next year will see a healthy recovery provided a swathe of relief measures recommended to the government are enacted. \n   \n  Separately Ryanair was frantically working to repatriate customers stranded in Spain after the country was thrown into lockdown arrangements. It has also cancelled all flights to and from Poland. \n  \u201cRyanair Group Airlines (including Buzz and Lauda) has been forced to severely reduce flights to/from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from 24.00 Sun 15 Mar until 24.00 Thurs 19 Mar,\u201d it said in a statement. \n  It added it was \u201ccontacting all affected customers by email to advise them of their options and we urge customs not to call us\u201d. \n  Earlier, it announced all flights \u201cto and from Poland have been cancelled from midnight on Saturday to midnight on 31 March\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 12.36pm GMT \n \n \n  11.56am GMT  \n UK advises against 'all but essential' travel to US \n  \n  The Foreign Office has advised against \u201call but essential travel\u201d to the US after president Trump introduced a travel ban on the UK over the coronavirus pandemic. \n  A Foreign Office spokesman said:  \n   \n   We are advising against all but essential travel to the USA following the US government announcement imposing restrictions on travel from the UK (and Ireland) effective from midnight on Monday March 16 EST (4am GMT on Tuesday March 17). \n   \n  British nationals with journeys planned and citizens already in the US are advised to contact their airlines or tour operators. \n  \n Updated at 12.18pm GMT \n \n \n  11.55am GMT  \n  \n  Health minister Nadine Dorries has reassured people panic-buying toilet roll that she has not run out of the bathroom essential during her week in self-isolation. \n  However, it was unclear how many rolls she had in her house when her period of quarantine began after she tested positive earlier this week.  \n   \n   \n    Having lived through #Coronavirus can I assure everyone that at no time during the seven days we were in isolation at home did we even once have to face a secondary crisis and run out of loo roll. \ud83e\uddfb\u2014 Nadine Dorries \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (@NadineDorries) March 15, 2020\n    \n   \n  A piece authored by the novelist has been published n the Times (paywall) this morning, documenting the Tory MP\u2019s coronavirus ordeal. \n   \n   I will always remember how I felt the moment I was told that I had tested positive for the coronavirus \u2014 not least because it was the very last thing I was expecting to hear. \n   A diagnosis would make no difference to how I behaved or dealt with my symptoms. But I had my 84-year-old mother staying with me for a few weeks and, despite the fact that she has survived polio, rheumatic fever, major heart surgery and a world war, she is not in the best of health. \n   The community nursing team were waiting for me as I drove into a Covid-19 testing centre on a local industrial estate. It resembled the tyre-change bay at my local garage. \n   Unlike with my situation, we know exactly where [her mother] caught it from and the irony is, despite her having had major surgery to replace the valves in her heart damaged by childhood illness, despite her pacemaker and breathlessness, her lifetime of smoking, hard work in her early years and poor diet, she had much milder symptoms than me. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.48am GMT  \n  \n  G7 leaders will discuss the importance of a coordinated response to the impact of coronavirus on the global economy, according to No 10 following a phone conversation between Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe. \n  A Downing Street spokesperson said: \n   \n   The prime minister spoke to Japanese prime minister Abe about the coronavirus pandemic. \n   The leaders updated each other on their countries\u2019 efforts to curb the spread of the virus. The prime minister stressed the importance the UK is placing on taking a science-led approach when deciding what measures to implement. \n   The prime minister and prime minister Abe agreed on the importance of international coordination to tackle the virus and its wider impact, particularly on the global economy, and they looked forward to the call between G7 leaders to discuss this. \n   The prime minster and prime minister Abe also discussed the UK and Japan\u2019s efforts to combat climate change ahead of COP26 in Glasgow later this year. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.57pm GMT \n \n \n  11.42am GMT  \n  \n  Following reports of passengers not being able to claim refunds on flights to Spain after the British government advised against all but essential travel to the whole country, Ryanair has told customers they will be informed of their options. \n   \n   \n    Customer Notice: Ryanair Group reduces flights to/from Spain from Monday 16 March to Thursday 19 March.

If we close to the public and also close the public gallery, caf\u00e9, shop, toilets etc, then efforts could be employed to concentrate on cleaning elsewhere in the building. \n   \n   \n    I presume the aim is to try and keep the members meeting for as long as possible and, as such, restricting the visitors to the building would also help to substantially cut the risk to elected members.  \n    Closing the building to the public would also mean the possibility of a reduced police presence and less pressure on our security staff. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.07am GMT  \n  \n  Union leaders are calling for private hospital beds in the UK to be used rent free, to ease pressure on NHS hospitals dealing with the coronavirus crisis. \n  The GMB union has launched a petition urging the prime minister to requisition private hospital beds, amid reports the NHS is to spend up to \u00a32.4m a day to do so. \n  Rehana Azam, GMB national officer, said:  \n   \n   It\u2019s time to take back these beds for the NHS, rent free. This is a public health emergency. Not a business opportunity for shoddy private healthcare chums to profiteer from distress. \n   Not a penny of taxpayer cash should line pockets of grotesquely wealthy health firms. Private resources must be requisitioned for public good. \n   \n   \n    Related: NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus crisis  \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.00am GMT  \n  \n  France will start reducing plane, train and coach services between cities from Sunday to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, two ministers said on Sunday. \n  In a joint news conference, ecology minister Elisabeth Borne and transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said cargo services would continue as normal, as would city metro services. \n  \u201cWe have to limit our movements as much as possible. Long distance trips must be kept to what is strictly necessary,\u201d Borne said. \n  Djebbari said the number of long-distance trains would be cut by half, while several airport terminals in Paris would be closed.  \n  Meanwhile, social distancing measures were observed in Paris as people stood a metre apart from each other while queueing at a bakery which is only letting three people in at a time this morning. \n  \n \n \n  10.53am GMT  \n Iran death toll rises 113 in a day \n  \n  Iran\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus has reached 724, with 113 new deaths in the past 24 hours, an official confirmed, adding that some 13,938 people have been infected across the country. \n  \u201cIn the past 24 hours, 1,209 new cases have been confirmed ... with 113 deaths in the past 24 hours, the death toll has reached 724,\u201d tweeted Alireza Vahabzadeh, an adviser to Iran\u2019s health minister. \n  Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s official leading the response to the coronavirus outbreak acknowledged that it could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe US sanctions. \n  \n Updated at 11.10am GMT \n \n \n  10.49am GMT  \n  \n  Colombia is to expel four Europeans for violating compulsory quarantine protocols designed to halt the spread of the coronavirus, just hours after it closed its border with Venezuela, the government said on Saturday. \n  Two men and two women of French and Spanish nationality will be deported after ignoring mandatory instructions to isolate themselves and leaving their hotels, against the warnings of staff, the migration agency said. \n  Colombia has so far reported 22 cases of the virus and has declared a health emergency to contain the disease. Measures include suspending public gatherings of more than 500 people and blocking cruise ships from entering its ports, Reuters reported. \n  President Ivan Duque said Colombia would close its border with Venezuela starting Saturday, while arrivals who are not residents or nationals and have stayed in Europe or Asia during the last two weeks will not be allowed to enter from Monday. \n  \n \n \n  10.44am GMT  \n  \n  Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said Britain has not ruled out following other countries and closing restaurants, bars and other shops to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. \n  When asked if ministers were planning on shutting up shops other than pharmacies and supermarkets, Hancock told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled that out, we will do what is necessary.\u201d \n  Government contingency plans briefed a fortnight ago that retired doctors, and leavers of the profession, would be called on to return to work in the event of a major pandemic were met with scepticism. \n  Scores of retired NHS doctors and nurses told the Guardian they are against returning to work to help tackle coronavirus, with many saying it would threaten their physical and mental health. \n  Asked whether he is confident in the government\u2019s approach of calling on retired doctors to help, BMA chair Dr Nagpaul said:  \n   \n   I think that we need information now, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got that information. As I said earlier, you can\u2019t just get doctors to return back to work instantly \u2013 we need to understand how they\u2019ll be registered, how they\u2019ll be trained, exactly what they\u2019ll be doing \u2013 especially for many retired doctors who could also be in a risk group. \n   They can provide care but in a remote fashion, not patient-facing. We really need those answers, plans, now. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.49am GMT \n \n \n  10.33am GMT  \n  \n  Freedom of movement will be \u201cmassively limited\u201d in Austria as part of drastic measures to fight the spread of Covid-19.  \n  Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced the measures would include closing playgrounds and sports grounds across the alpine country from Tuesday. \n  Non-essential shops, restaurants and bars will also close. Travel restrictions will be further tightened, with border checks imposed between Austria and Switzerland, people no longer allowed to enter the country from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Ukraine and Russia. \n  Kurz said the coming weeks would be \u201cchallenging, difficult and painful\u201d, but assured the public that the supply of crucial goods would be uninterrupted.  \n  Shops including pharmacies and drugstores are to remain open for now. Austria has had 800 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far, with the Tyrol region emerging as one of the hotspots of the infection. One person has died as a result of the virus. \n  \n Updated at 10.36am GMT \n \n \n  10.25am GMT  \n  \n  Ireland\u2019s taoiseach has warned he may seek enforcement powers to stop large gatherings in pubs after drunken scenes in Dublin\u2019s city centre last night caused alarm with cabinet colleagues.  \n   \n   \n    No indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people applies to pubs &amp; clubs.

You could make them very very sick. \n   \n  His warning comes 12 hours after European affairs minister Helen McEntee expressed alarm following posts on social media of drunken sing-alongs in pubs. \n  She pleaded with the public to be vigilant and pay heed to social distancing advice which warns that to do otherwise could force closures across the hospitality sector with devastating consequences for business owners, their staff and families.  \n   \n   \n    A decision to close pubs restaurants and other outlets will have a devastating impact on so many workers.

A Canadian tourist also tested positive there shortly after she had left the kingdom, where the all-important tourism season has just started. \n  The four French people are said to have stayed at a Dead Sea hotel. I\u2019ve been ringing around to find out where exactly, but a staffer at one told me they had yet to be told anything and were \u201cvery worried\u201d.  \n  Before these new infections, the sole confirmed case was a man who had contracted the disease but recovered. Jordan has shut schools, universities, mosques, churches and tourist sites to try to contain the virus.  \n  \n Updated at 10.39am GMT \n \n \n  10.16am GMT  \n  \n  Greece has closed all its archaeological sites including the 5th century BCE Acropolis. With few other places to go, Athenians this weekend gathered on rocks beneath the ancient monument.  \n  \n \n \n  10.06am GMT  \n Lack of ventilators in the UK 'consequence of NHS under-funding', BMA says \n  \n  The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, has suggested that sustained cuts left the UK\u2019s public healthcare system far more unprepared than other European countries at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. \n  He said the UK\u2019s relative lack of ventilators was \u201ca result of a decade of under-funding\u201d and urged the government to provide \u201cclear, decisive plans\u201d to ensure that healthcare workers can provide the care patients need. \n   \n   Our starting position unfortunately has been far worse than many other of our European nations \u2013 we have about a quarter of the critical care beds that Germany has, as an example, so it\u2019s really critical, it\u2019s really important that we now see transparently what plans the government has to expand that capacity.\u201d \n   \n  Asked whether the whole GP system needs to be looked at, Nagpaul added:  \n   \n   We need to have clear plans how patients can be remotely managed and how the technology can support that. \n   \n   \n   Yes. And one of the most immediate priorities of course is we don\u2019t have enough doctors. Before the outbreak we were 10,000 doctors short, so we\u2019re very worried and the doctors I represent are very concerned that they don\u2019t, for example, have adequate protection. \n   \n  Meanwhile, the Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy accused the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak of being a \u201cshambles\u201d. \n  She criticised ministers for \u201cgoing to ground\u201d after an apparent U-turn on banning mass gatherings and reports that powers may be handed to police and immigration officers to arrest sick people who will not self-isolate. \n  She told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show:  \n   \n   I think even he [Matt Hancock] will accept that the last 48 hours has been a real shambles. This is causing serious concern out in the public. People just don\u2019t know what to do for the best. \n   There is no reason to panic but we need far more information from the Government. This is a public health crisis and so the public must have confidence in the strategy the government is following. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.42am GMT \n \n \n  9.55am GMT  \n  \n  More than 150 \u201cmutual aid\u201d groups have been formed across the UK to provide support from shopping, dog walking and picking up prescriptions within communities. \n  The groups, which number at least 174 and are being coordinated nationally by \u2018Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK\u2019, have organised online meetings today and are handing out flyers in streets. \n  As well as practical support the groups are offering telephone calls with people who are self-isolating due to infection or increased vulnerability. \n  Anna Vickerstaff, one of the coordinators of the national network, said: \n   \n   Groups are being set up and run entirely by volunteers - and our hope is that they can help to make sure people who need support get it. With the NHS and public services having been so ruthlessly underfunded in the last decade, we really just want to make sure that people don\u2019t end up suffering alone, or without the basics and support that they need from the outside world. \n   There\u2019s some pretty big questions about whether or not the government\u2019s response to this crisis has been fit for purpose. So it\u2019s even more important that so many ordinary people across the country are keen to offer solidarity to each other in a moment of need.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.49am GMT  \n  \n  Releasing low-risk prisoners is not yet part of government plans to limit the spread of the coronavirus in \u201cgrossly overcrowded\u201d prisons, according to the Prison Officers Association. \n  When asked by Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge if releasing some prisoners was in the contingency plan, Steve Gillan, general secretary of the association, said:  \n   \n   Not as yet but previous governments have done what was called an executive release of prisoners, that may come in the future to free up spaces in prisons. \n   \n  He explained this could be in the form of temporary release or a decision by the secretary of state to release low-risk category prisoners towards the end of their sentences. \n  He added there were problems caused by a limited amount of single-capacity cells in the prison system. \n   \n   No one to my knowledge as of this morning has actually been tested positive but they have been isolated in single-cell accommodation. We all know prisons are grossly overcrowded and that can only happen for a period of time. \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.43am GMT  \n  \n  People in Norway have been ordered to leave their countryside cabins and return to their homes, due to fears rural hospitals could be ovewhelmed, according to Norwegian media. \n  The municipalities that have many cottages should be able to take care of their own inhabitants in a very demanding situation, health minister Bent H\u00f8ie reportedly said. \n   \n   This means that everyone now has to follow the strong request of the prime minister to pack their cases and go home. If they do not, we will prohibit them from staying in the cabin. \n   \n  It comes after prime minister Erna Solberg threatened to deploy the civil defence to bring people home from their cabins.  \n  \n Updated at 9.47am GMT \n \n \n  9.39am GMT  \n  \n   \n    Related: One doctor\u2019s story: \u2018We don\u2019t have the masks, goggles \u2013 or the staff\u2019  \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.32am GMT  \n  \n  An 83-year-old British national has tested positive for coronavirus after disembarking a cruise ship in Chile, local media reported. \n  The man, who was travelling on the Silver Explorer, is in a \u201cgood condition\u201d in hospital in Coyhaique, Patagonia, the country\u2019s health minister Jaime Manalich said, as quoted in La Tercera. \n  Chile has quarantined nearly 1,300 passengers on board the Silver Explorer and another ship in the port of Chacabuco. \n  Following the man\u2019s diagnosis, the 500 residents of Caleta Tortel have also been made subject of restrictions for a fortnight after the passenger was in contact with several members of the community, the Chilean health ministry said. \n  \n \n \n  9.30am GMT  \n UK over-70s to be asked to self isolate for up to four months \n  \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  Here is some from Matt Hancock\u2019s announcement earlier. He said requesting all over 70-year-olds to self-isolate is a \u201cvery big ask\u201d, but is a measure which is for their own \u201cself-protection\u201d. \n  In the coming weeks, over-70\u2019s will be asked to self-isolate for up to four months, in order to protect them from the virus, he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. \n   \n   That is in the action plan, yes, and we will be setting it out with more detail when it is the right time to do so, because we absolutely appreciate that it is a very big ask of the elderly and the vulnerable, and it\u2019s for their own self-protection \u2026 Certainly in the coming weeks, absolutely. \n   Our generation has never been tested like this. Our grandparents were, during the second world war, when our cities were bombed during the Blitz. \n   Despite the pounding every night, the rationing, the loss of life, they pulled together in one gigantic national effort. Today our generation is facing its own test, fighting a very real and new disease.\u201d \n   \n  Experts on the UK\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies have set out the need for extra action to slow the spread of the disease. The panel advised that the next interventions \u201cwill need to be instituted soon\u201d. \n  Those measures will include steps to shield the vulnerable from the virus, including the elderly and those with existing health problems, by telling them to stay in their houses or care homes. There could also be a shift to household isolation rather than individual self-isolation. \n  Meanwhile, a new-born baby in England who has tested positive for coronavirus is likely to be one of the world\u2019s youngest patients with the disease. The infant and its mother both tested positive at a north London hospital and staff who had contact with them have been advised to self-isolate. \n  The developments come as the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19 has been called into question. \n  But Hancock denied that achieving herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s policy. Responding to criticism from parts of the scientific community, and when asked by Ridge if he was playing \u201croulette\u201d with public safety, Hancock replied: \u201cNo, obviously.\u201d \n   \n   What we will do is listen to all the credible scientists and we will look at all the evidence.

The challenge here is to make sure the vaccine is safe and it works, and unfortunately, that takes a period of time to do so realistically. \n   It\u2019s very unlikely that we are going to have a vaccine for the present round of this epidemic. We are talking months, up to a year. \n   \n  Walport added it was \u201cquite likely\u201d that a large percentage of the population would get coronavirus, but many would be mild or sub-clinical. \n  Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Boris Johnson to hold another press conference today if the coronavirus situation has changed. \n  Speaking on the same programme earlier, he said:  \n   \n   The World Health Organization is saying that we should continue testing and contact tracing. They\u2019re saying that is the best way to break the chain of contagion. \n   The UK have taken a different view that if you feel ill that you just stay at home for seven days and won\u2019t be tested. \n   Many people are saying to me that they need a Covid-19 test if they\u2019re ill because they need to know whether they should be interacting with other people in a few weeks\u2019 time. \n   So I just need to understand better why the government is taking a different approach, based on its science, from other countries and I think that\u2019s why it is so important that all the scientific modelling for example is published. \n   If things have changed since Thursday, and things are changing quickly, if things have changed since the prime minister\u2019s press conference on Thursday then the prime minister should be doing another press conference today and explaining why things have changed. \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.52am GMT \n \n \n  9.05am GMT  \n  \n  German newspaper Welt am Sonntag has reported that US president Donald Trump has sought exclusive rights to a vaccine for the coronavirus which is being developed by a German-based company, CureVac. \n  The report, which quoted unnamed sources, said Trump had offered large sums of money to German scientists working on the vaccine, and that the Germany government was working to prevent the US procuring it on this basis. \n  \n Updated at 9.10am GMT \n \n \n  9.02am GMT  \n Two more deaths confirmed in Australia \n  \n  Australian health authorities have confirmed two more deaths from coronavirus in the past three days. A 77-year-old Queensland woman died in New South Wales on Friday.  \n  NSW Health said the woman had recently arrived in Sydney. According to AAP, she developed symptoms on the plane, was taken to hospital and died the same day.  \n  NSW Health also said a 90-year-old woman - a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge \u2013 died on Saturday. Testing has confirmed that she had COVID-19. \n  Four people diagnosed with coronavirus have now died in NSW while an elderly man who spent time on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in Perth, Western Australia, earlier in March. \n  \n Updated at 9.07am GMT \n \n \n  8.58am GMT  \n  \n  Greek authorities have confirmed a fourth death from coronavirus, saying a 53-year-old man succumbed to Covid-19 early on Sunday. \n  The man, the youngest victim so far, was reported to have contracted the virus working in a hospital in the northern city of Kastoria. Famous for its fur trade \u2013 and links with Italy - the town has been hard hit by coronavirus. Locals who attended Milan\u2019s fashion week in February are among those who have fallen ill.  \n  News of the fatality follows a health ministry announcement that 228 people have so far contracted the virus in Greece \u2013 the vast majority are Greek and do not of course include the like of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson who were recently made honorary citizens of the country.  \n  Of that number five are said to be in critical condition in specialist hospital units around the country.  \n  As of today, Greeks will be banned from public beaches and ski resorts after prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis took the unprecedented step of ordering both closed in a further bid to curb the spread of the novel virus. The leader was prompted to make the move after scenes emerged of Greeks converging on shorelines as temperatures climbed to 22C on Saturday.  \n  \u201cI just gave the order for all organised beaches and ski resorts to close tomorrow. The situation is serious and requires responsibility from all. We should avoid public places with lots of people. Let us all rise to the occasion.\u201d \n   \n    Related: Tom Hanks becomes honorary citizen of Greece  \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.06am GMT \n \n \n  8.55am GMT  \n  \n  Hancock is confident the food supply will continue, though he again refused to provide a guarantee. \n   \n   I understand why people are stocking up but they have to behave responsibly ... and consider the impact their stocking up may have on others. And we stand ready to take further measures if that\u2019s necessary. \n   \n  Questioned about the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been described as idiosyncratic, he said the country will take the right decisions at the right time based on the scientific advice. \n  He said the government would publish its coronavirus modelling, from which the scientific advice is based, within the next couple of days. \n  \u201cOur advice is one of the most transparent in the world,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe best science is done in the open so people can challenge ... and make suggestions.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  8.49am GMT  \n UK government calls on manufacturing companies to switch production to ventilators \n  \n  The UK has been through worse as a country but the coronavirus pandemic is a very significant challenge, health secretary Matt Hancock has told Sky. \n  It will disrupt the lives of almost everyone in the country, he conceded. He called for a \u201cnational effort\u201d from hand-washing to ventilator production to help prevent the disease spreading and to save lives. \n   \n   Every single person can act by washing their hands to prevent the disease spreading. Washing your hands is the single most important thing you can do. It slows the spread and kills the virus. \n   We are working to buy as many ventilators as possible. We start with around 5,000 and we need many times more than that.  \n   \n  He said government was working with the private sector to buy the ventilators that are available and to encourage manufacturing companies to switch production to the machines. \n   \n   The demand for them is incredibly high. It is not possible to produce too many of them. Anybody who can should turn their production and engineering minds to the production of ventilators. \n   \n  However, he could not confirm everyone who requires one will have access, and he confirmed that the government is set to ask, at some point in the coming weeks, over-70s to self-isolate for months at some point in the UK. \n  \n Updated at 9.09am GMT \n \n \n  8.34am GMT  \n  \n  Thanks Helen.

However, the actual number of infected Americans is certain to be far higher, with the true toll obscured by a calamitous lack of testing. \n  A lack of planning and restrictions that barred testing people without symptoms, even though the virus can be asymptomatic for some time, or those not arriving from overseas virus hotspots has needlessly worsened the situation, critics said. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus: Trump's stumbles and testing failures pave way to disaster, experts say  \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.47am GMT  \n  \n  In other developments around Latin America on Saturday, Colombia expelled two French nationals and two Spaniards for violating coronavirus quarantine rules. \n  The two couples separately took tourist trips in defiance of restrictions imposed on visitors from the worst-affected countries, immigration officials said. \n  Ecuador announced it was closing its borders to foreigners after the country registered its second coronavirus death. \n  In Bolivia, a ban on direct flights to and from Europe went into effect on Saturday. Travelers from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain are also banned from entry. \n  Panama banned flights from Asia, one day after blocking flights from Europe. \n  Authorities also announced that schools will shutter in Venezuela, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Uruguay. \n  As of 2200 GMT Saturday, Latin America had registered 6 coronavirus deaths and 430 cases of infection. \n  \n \n \n  6.44am GMT  \n  \n  Chile has quarantined more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced Saturday. \n  Both ships are cruising the Chilean fjords in Patagonia. \n  The 85-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus after getting off the Silver Explorer ship in the far southern port of Caleta Tortel, 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) from Santiago. \n  The man was later transferred to a hospital in the city of Coyhaique where he tested positive for the virus. \n  Chile has taken broad measures against the spread of the virus, banning events of more than 500 people, recommending people work from home, and ordering the quarantine of 2,600 students attending an elite private school in Santiago. \n  \n \n \n  6.38am GMT  \n  \n  Thailand reported 32 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the total infections in the Southeast Asian country to 114, health officials said. It was the biggest daily jump in cases in Thailand, which was one of the first countries outside China to report coronavirus infections that has since swept much of the world. \n  \n \n \n  6.34am GMT  \n  \n  Myanmar\u2019s government has rejected suggestions that the country has undetected cases of the virus, reiterating that it is free of any infections and that \u201cthe lifestyle and diet of Myanmar citizens\u201d has helped protect the country.  \n  According to Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-run news source, the director general of the ministry of office of the state counsellor, U Zaw Htay, told a press conference: \n   \n   Myanmar does not share the customs of greeting with handshakes, hugs or kisses that [Western] countries have. It also does not have a high number of credit card users compared to other nations, as the person handling credit cards at the counter would be in close contact with hundred of different people in a day. This is avoided by Myanmar\u2019s predominant use of paper currency.  \n   \n  U Zaw Htay added that the government was taking measures to prepare for the pandemic, and that people should avoid large gatherings, maintain good personal hygiene and not panic buy at shops.Severe legal action would be taken against anyone sharing fake news online and against any businesses attempting to make profit from the situation, reporters were told.Myanmar recently cancelled water festivals due to take place next month to mark the Buddhist New Year. Other Southeast Asian countries are also scaling back planned events. \n  \n \n \n  6.27am GMT  \n  \n  South Africa\u2019s mining and tourism industries are bracing for a virus buffeting, AFP reports.  \n  Around 18.5% of South African exports go to China, with mining commodities making up around 86% of total trade with the Asian country. \n  With China\u2019s growth expected to slow as a result of Covid-19, the demand for minerals is also expected to take a knock potentially affecting commodity prices and costing the industry millions. \n  South Africa\u2019s economy is already fragile. \n  It slipped into recession in the final three months of 2019, the second contraction to hit the economy in as many years. That contraction was largely blamed on erratic electricity supplies. \n  The virus \u201cwill turn out to be a national crisis\u201d and \u201cit will have a huge impact... on our economy which as we all know is in a very precarious situation,\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said when the first case was detected last week. \n  China ranked the seventh largest origin of foreign visitors to South Africa in 2018. \n  South Africa has so far imposed no travel bans on Chinese visitors, but Beijing has blocked outbound group travel from China. \n  \u201cDespite the fact that we have had very few cases of the virus, the local tourism industry has already suffered serious losses,\u201d lamented Tourism Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, said earlier last week. The country has 38 confirmed cases.  \n  The South African fisheries industry was one of the first casualties after China halted animal imports. \n  China traditionally imports 95% of South African rock lobsters harvests. \n  \n \n \n  6.19am GMT  \n  \n  Queensland, Australia state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has shed some light on how the federal government\u2019s self-quarantine requirement will be enforced, as the state sees its biggest one-day jump since the start of the outbreak, with 15 new cases. \n  Palaszczuk said there were heavy fines for anyone who did not follow the directive to self-isolate under the \u2018Public Health Emergency Act\u2019. \n  \u201cThat bill was passed in early February and there are penalties for not complying with the notification and that is around $13,000,\u201d she told AAP.  \n  \u201cWe have random police checks to make sure people are compliant with that notice.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  6.11am GMT  \n  \n  The announcement from Israel that it will use anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise coronavirus transmission follows a series of ever-stricter restrictions imposed by the Israeli government to contain the virus, Reuters reports. The Israeli military said earlier on Saturday that it had ordered all troops to be back on their bases by Sunday morning, and that combat soldiers should prepare for a lengthy stay with no leave for up to a month. Last week anyone entering Israel was ordered to self-isolate for two weeks and schools have been shut. Tens of thousands of Israelis are presently quarantined. Israel\u2019s Health Ministry said 193 people have tested positive, with no fatalities. Many had been on international flights in the past two weeks.  \n  \n \n \n  6.10am GMT  \n  \n  More now on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to use anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission.  \n  Cyber tech monitoring would be deployed to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus, subject to cabinet approval, Netanyahu told a news conference in Jerusalem. \u201cWe will very soon begin using technology ... digital means that we have been using in order to fight terrorism,\u201d Netanyahu said. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.  The Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security service, confirmed that it was examining the use of its technological capabilities to fight coronavirus, at the request of Netanyahu and the Health Ministry, Reuters reports. Avner Pinchuk, a privacy expert with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said such capabilities could include real-time tracking of infected persons\u2019 mobile phones to spot quarantine breaches and backtracking through meta-data to figure out where they had been and who they had contacted. \u201cI am troubled by this announcement. I understand that we are in unique circumstances, but this seems potentially like over-reach. Much will depend on how intrusive the new measures are,\u201d said Pinchuk. The Shin Bet, however, said in its statement that quarantine enforcement was not on the table. \u201cThere is no intention of using said technologies for enforcement or tracking in the context of isolation guidelines,\u201d it said.  \n  \n \n \n  6.04am GMT  \n Hoboken announces night curfew \n  \n  The US city of Hoboken, across the Hudson River from New York City, has announced a night curfew starting 16 March and ordered bars and restaurants to conduct only delivery services amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.  \n  In a statement, Mayor Ravi Bhalla said all residents of Hoboken, New Jersey, will be required to remain in their homes between 10 pm and 5 am, \u201cexcept for emergencies, or if you are required to work by your employer\u201d. The mayor said that bars and restaurants in the city will not be allowed to serve food from Sunday, 11 a.m. local time. However, they will be allowed to conduct delivery services. Hoboken reported its first case of coronavirus on Friday. More than 2,900 cases of coronavirus and at least 57 deaths have been reported in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.  \n  \n \n \n  6.01am GMT  \n Uzbekistan confirms first coronavirus case \n  \n  An Uzbek citizen has tested positive for coronavirus after returning from France, Uzbekistan\u2019s Healthcare Ministry said on Sunday, marking the first infection from the virus in the Central Asian country of 34 million.  \n  It said it was taking the necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Uzbekistan\u2019s state airline said on Sunday it was suspending or curbing flights to a number of cities in Western Europe, Asia and the Middle East until the end of April. \n  \n \n \n  5.58am GMT  \n  \n  The Jakarta Post reports that the Indonesian transportation minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, has tested positive for coronavirus and is being treated in hospital.  \n  \n \n \n  5.46am GMT  \n  \n  New South Wales, Australia attorney general Mark Speakman has announced that \u201call new Supreme and District Court jury trials will be suspended until further notice,\u201d from Monday, 16 March. \u201cJury trials already underway will continue,\u201d he said in a statement.  \n  \u201cVisitors not involved in proceedings are asked to stay away from any NSW court building and measures will also be implemented to reduce contact between parties in current matters. \n  \u201cThe Local Court will also implement greater use of Audio Visual Link technology to minimise the number of people in court.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  5.36am GMT  \n  \n  The Australian state of Queensland has confirmed fifteen new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 55, including three passengers from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. \n  This post has been corrected to reflect a correction in the number of new cases made by the Queensland government.  \n  \n Updated at 5.48am GMT \n \n \n  5.33am GMT  \n  \n  Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will debate against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday.  \n  As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago, AP reports. \n  The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday\u2019s contest. The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday\u2019s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus.  \n  For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times.  \n  \n \n \n  5.24am GMT  \n  \n  Central American countries took further and tougher steps to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus on Saturday with measures ranging from bans on large gatherings to travel restrictions, Reuters reports. El Salvador\u2019s Congress approved a series of emergency measures sought by President Nayib Bukele to prevent the spread of the virus and to fend off the risk of a public health crisis.  \n  The measures include restrictions on entry to and exit from El Salvador, as well as curbs on public gatherings. El Salvador has so far not reported any cases of coronavirus. Earlier, Honduras and Guatemala banned public gatherings to prevent the virus from spreading as quickly as it has in Asian and European countries. Panama had already banned large gatherings. Meanwhile, authorities in Panama said flights arriving from Europe and Asia would be temporarily suspended, with the exception of flights that transport doctors, medical equipment or other humanitarian aid.  \n  \n \n \n  5.21am GMT  \n Former Chinese executive who criticised Xi over virus handling is missing \n  \n  An influential former Chinese property executive who called President Xi Jinping a \u201cclown\u201d over a speech he made last month about the government\u2019s efforts to battle the coronavirus has gone missing, three of his friends told Reuters.  \n  Ren Zhiqiang, a member of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party and a former top executive of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group, has not been contactable since March 12, they said. \u201cMany of our friends are looking for him,\u201d his close friend and businesswoman Wang Ying said in a statement to Reuters, describing them as being \u201cextremely anxious\u201d. \u201cRen Zhiqiang is a public figure and his disappearance is widely know. The institutions responsible for this need to give a reasonable and legal explanation for this as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Calls made by Reuters to Ren\u2019s mobile phone went unanswered. The Beijing police did not immediately respond to requests by phone and fax for comment on Sunday. China\u2019s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. An essay Ren shared with people he knew in recent weeks took aim at a speech Xi made on 23 February. Copies of his essay were later posted online by others. In the essay, which does not mention Xi by name, Ren said after studying the speech he \u201csaw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his \u2018new clothes,\u2019 but a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor,\u201d according to a version posted by China Digital Times, a U.S.-based website. Ren\u2019s disappearance comes as censorship over how local media and online users discuss the epidemic has tightened in recent weeks.  \n  \n \n \n  5.11am GMT  \n  \n  America has no real public health system \u2013 coronavirus has a clear run, writes Robert Reich, former US secretary of labor and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley.  \n   \n   As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it. \n   Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job. \n   At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word \u201cpublic\u201d \u2013 as in public health, public education or public welfare \u2013 means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good. \n   \n   \n    Related: America has no real public health system \u2013 coronavirus has a clear run | Robert Reich  \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.06am GMT  \n  \n  In Australia, here is everything we know about the new self-isolation requirement:  \n   \n    Related: All overseas arrivals in Australia must self-isolate for 14 days under new coronavirus rules  \n   \n  And here is what the government has told people about a lockdown, an option it says is still on the table:  \n   \n    Related: Australian government says a coronavirus general lockdown remains an option  \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.08am GMT \n \n \n  4.51am GMT  \n  \n  In the US, Yale University has confirmed its first case of coronavirus and asked students not to return to campus, according to an email sent to students and shared with the Guardian.  \n  Yale President Peter Salovey writes:  \n   \n   Earlier today, Director of Yale Health Paul Genecin notified us that a member of our community has tested positive for Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on a preliminary test, and that we await confirmation of this result. Another community member and a household contact are also undergoing diagnostic evaluation, and we await test results for these individuals. \n   \n  The Ivy League university had previously asked students to remain at home through April 5th.  \n  It has now decided that students will be kept off campus and teaching will be conducted online for the entire spring semester, including final examinations. The Guardian understands the Spring semester ends on 6 May.  \n  \u201cI hasten to note one vital exception: Yale will house those students who simply cannot go home, whether because they come from a country severely affected by Covid-19, or for other serious reasons,\u201d says Salovey.  \n  The university has asked students not to return to campus to retrieve their belongings, and only staff \u201cwhose work is deemed critical to current operations\u201d are expected to return to work.  \n  \n Updated at 4.54am GMT \n \n \n  4.38am GMT  \n  \n  The Australian Society of Anaesthetists is calling for all elective surgeries to be postponed to to the increased demand on hospital resources due to the coronavirus pandemic.  \n  ASA President Dr Suzi Nou said in a statement:  \n   \n   We are calling for the immediate postponement of elective surgery that can be safely deferred \u2013 a few weeks of inconvenience now could save many lives down the line.  \n   The reality is that we will still be performing emergency surgery while at the same time dealing with this new emergency which will put enormous strain on our critical care services. \n   Elective surgery uses resources that may be life-saving down the line. Postponing this surgery can be a staged approach. We can act today by safely postponing surgery for patients that are going to require admission to an intensive care unit.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.23am GMT  \n  \n  If you happen to spot interesting or cheering coronavirus news \u2013 or anything I\u2019ve missed \u2013 please do drop me a line on Twitter @helenrsullivan. \n  \n \n \n  4.23am GMT  \n  \n  The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Japan rose to 1,484 on Sunday, increasing by a faster pace than the previous day, public broadcaster NHK reported. The total number of infections includes 697 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 14 returnees on charter flights from China, according to NHK data. Deaths in the country related to the virus stand at 29, up one from the previous day. The total number of deaths include 7 from the cruise ship. \n  \n Updated at 5.38am GMT \n \n \n  4.19am GMT  \n  \n  Argentina has banned entry to non-residents who have traveled to a country highly affected by coronavirus in the last 14 days, the government officially announced late on Saturday. The ban was established for 30 days, according to the decree published in the official bulletin. The bulletin did not specify which countries would be included in the ban, though Argentina already temporarily stopped issuing visas to travellers from the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Britain and many European countries. Argentina now has 45 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the health ministry said, up from 21 on March 12. \n  \n Updated at 5.39am GMT \n \n \n  4.18am GMT  \n  \n  An update on American Airlines reducing its flights now: it plans to cut 75% of its international flights through May 6 and ground nearly all of its widebody fleet, the company said on Saturday.  \n  The dramatic announcement by the largest US airline came hours after the White House said the United States would widen new travel restrictions on Europeans to include travellers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, starting Monday night.  \n  \n \n \n  4.17am GMT  \n  \n  South Australia has reported one new case of coronavirus, bringing the state\u2019s total to 20.  \n  \n \n \n  4.15am GMT  \n  \n  Tasmania, Australia has suspended all cruise ship visits to its ports after the island state recorded its sixth coronavirus case, AAP reports. Shortly after the announcement, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said the entire country will ban cruise ships from foreign ports for an initial 30 days. \n  Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein said he will direct TasPorts, which runs the state\u2019s ports, to suspend all cruise ship visits until June 30, as a precautionary measure. \n  A domestic cruise ship, carrying 43 mainly local passengers and which has been in Tasmanian waters since December 31, will make a final call to Hobart port on Sunday afternoon. \n  No passengers will disembark and it will depart later in the day. \n  Twelve cruise ship visits are scheduled during the period to June 30, including five to Hobart, five to Burnie and two to Port Arthur. \n  About 1400 passengers and staff abroad the Magnifica, which arrived in Hobart on Saturday, were told they could not return to the ship if they disembark, an MSC Cruises spokeswoman has told The Mercury. \n  Nobody on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers\u2019 health. \n  P&amp;O Cruises Australia on Saturday announced a 30-day pause in cruise operations to the impact of coronavirus. \n  \n Updated at 4.21am GMT \n \n \n  4.10am GMT  \n  \n  Still in Australia for a moment \u2013 just to wrap up that presser from Prime Minister Morrison and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Kelly, Australia is enforcing a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for all travellers, including Australians, arriving from overseas.  \n  Morrison says this requirement is legally enforceable, though he didn\u2019t have the details of precisely how that might work or what the penalties for non-compliance might be.  \n  Schools will remain open. No more handshakes.  \n  \u201cThere\u2019s no herd immunity,\u201d says Dr Kelly.  \n  \n Updated at 4.10am GMT \n \n \n  4.05am GMT  \n  \n  The US source is a \u201cmajor source\u201d of cases in Australia, says Morrison.  \n  The conference is over now, with a final message from the prime minister:  \n  \u201cSo long as Australians keep being Australians we\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  4.01am GMT  \n  \n  Australian prime minister Scott Morrison says he hopes Australians will not lose their \u201csense of Australianness\u201d, in response to a question about how social distancing might work:  \n  Is social distancing being instructedto schools, kids in schools? How is social distancing going to work? \n   \n   It\u2019s pretty straightforward. 1.5m, you are about 1.5m away. Ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless its close family and friends. It\u2019s all common sense. We don\u2019t need to tell Australians how to get out of bed in the morning and put their shoes and socks on and things like that.  \n   Australians understand, these are important, normal, social interaction measures that people can take an hour very intuitive and all about reducing the amount of direct physical contact you have with others... I really want Australians to get on with their lives as normally as possible but there will be disruptions and they will adjust, Australians can of course adjust. What I hope won\u2019t happened and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t is that we won\u2019t lose our sense of Australianness in all of this, we will support each other and if you have someone in self isolation, an elderly person next to you or down the road, they will be wisely exercising greater precautions about their social interactions. Make them a casserole and leave it on the door. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.18am GMT \n \n \n  3.56am GMT  \n  \n  Question: What is the penalty for committing the offence of not self-isolating? \n  Morrison: That will be a matter for the states and territories. \n  \n \n \n  3.55am GMT  \n  \n  Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is addressing media now. He says of the new self-quarantine requirement for all travellers arriving from overseas, including Australians:  \n   \n   Its legal enforcement, that will be the change. If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence so I think it\u2019s up to all of us that we are ensuring it is in place. Australians will exercise commonsense. This provides the backstop of a legal enforcement. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.51am GMT  \n  \n  Morrison says of cabinet:  \n   \n   It will now be meeting more regularly by video-conferencing rather than all cabinet members being in the one place, the national cabinet as it did today met through a secure audio-conferencing facility.  \n   Leaders and other politicians, you can expect to see not travelling as much.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.56am GMT \n \n \n  3.50am GMT  \n  \n  Australian prime minister Scott Morrison: \u201cNo more handshakes.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  3.49am GMT  \n  \n  Australian deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says:  \n   \n   We are also starting to see, here in Sydney but other cities and into our regional areas, some human to human transmission in Australia. Not necessarily related to travel, that will be the next step, more proportionate measures will need to be taken as that develops. These are difficult times and the disruption to societies very much felt by us in the health side of government. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.54am GMT \n \n \n  3.48am GMT  \n  \n  Dr Paul Kelly, Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, says \u2013 he seems to mean this reassuringly:  \n   \n   What is different about Australia is that we are not yet in winter. All of the places we are seeing this virus really escalate quickly now, to other parts of the world, are in the northern hemisphere. They are in the latter part of their winter months. They have flu seasons as well and all of the environmental elements that allow viruses to spread quickly are actually there in North America, in China, in other parts of northern Asia and we are seeing exactly what has happened there. In particular, not taking another action probably early enough in most of those countries. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.57am GMT \n \n \n  3.46am GMT  \n  \n  Australian deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is speaking now. He says:  \n   \n   The important issue of herd immunity that we talk about a lot in vaccination is exactly the challenge that we have at the moment. There\u2019s no herd immunity, everyone is susceptible to this virus in Australia. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.54am GMT \n \n \n  3.44am GMT  \n Australian schools to remain open, says PM \n  \n  On the decision not to close schools, Morrison says it was made for two reasons. One was the need to keep children from infecting other people outside schools. Second was the massive disruption it would cause on the economy. \n  Here is what he said: \n   \n   When you take children out of schools and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases the risk, and that is the understanding we have. There are also issues of herd immunity to elect children as well... And we may want to touch on those issues.  \n   The other issue is the disruption impact that they can have and put a great risk, the availability of critical workers such as nurses and doctors and others who are essential in the community because they would have to remain home and look after the children, and so while it may seem anti-intuitive, there is very good reasons why you would not be moving to broadscale closures of schools, that could make the situation worse, not better, and so the states and territories are not moving in that direction, we will consider this again at our meeting after Tuesday night. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.41am GMT  \n  \n  Morrison also announces new social distancing measures.  \n   \n   Non-essential static gatherings of more than 500 people occurring across the states and territories will be banned. This recommendation will be overseen by the state and territory governments although Morrison said the police would not be enforcing it.

Our main aim is to protect the vulnerable, he says.

Residents have been asked to stay home except for work and urgent errands under month-long restrictions that took effect Sunday.The city-wide quarantine means the suspension of domestic travel by land, air and sea to and from the capital region. Large gatherings like concerts, movies and cockfighting will be prohibited and most government work in executive department offices will be suspended in the metropolis. School closures at all levels were extended by a month. Officials said the temporary restrictions will not amount to a lockdown of the capital because many workers and emergency personnel like medical staff will be able to enter and leave the capital. Residents can move within the metropolis on their way to work or for urgent errands, including medical emergencies, officials said. \n  \n Updated at 3.09am GMT \n \n \n  2.44am GMT  \n  \n  In Australia, Dr Adam Visser, the director of critical care at Toowoomba hospital in regional Queensland, has posted an impassioned plea for the Australian community to take individual action to help \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and keep intensive care units from being overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. \n   \n   I\u2019m an intensive care specialist in a small city. \n   Coronavirus isn\u2019t just like the flu, but it\u2019s only really very dangerous to the elderly or the already unwell. Quite a lot of people in their 80s will die, but most of the rest of us will probably be OK. \n   If you\u2019re in your 70s and you get Coronavirus, you\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\u2019ve got a bed for you. \n   If you\u2019re in your 60s and you have a heart attack, you\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\u2019ve got a bed for you. \n   If you\u2019re in your 50s and need bowel cancer surgery, you\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\u2019ve got a bed for you. \n   If you\u2019re in your 40s and have a bad car accident, you\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\u2019ve got a bed for you. \n   If you\u2019re in your 30s and have terrible pre-eclampsia as a complication of pregnancy, you\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\u2019ve got a bed for you. \n   If you\u2019re in your 20s and have a bad reaction to a party drug, you\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\u2019ve got a bed for you. \n   I have 7 beds equipped with life support machines. We have a plan to increase to about 25. Getting more isn\u2019t a matter or more equipment or more money, that bit is easy. There are not enough skilled staff, even if we all work double shifts every day for six months (and we probably will). \n   If 50% of my city gets infected, that\u2019s 75,000 people. If 5% of them need life support (which is the estimate), that\u2019s 3750 people. For 25 beds. \n   And then I might not have a bed for you. \n   So it\u2019s up to you to flatten the curve. Wash your hands. Stay home. \n   \n  Visser finished his post asking the prime minister to \u201clock down\u201d Australia to halt the spread of Covid-19. \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.53am GMT \n \n \n  2.37am GMT  \n  \n  In transport news that\u2019s a little more fun:  \n   \n   \n    Yeaaaaah ..that\u2019s right pic.twitter.com/Wwg0RzH06W\u2014 AMAZINACE (@AMAZINACE) March 14, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.37am GMT \n \n \n  2.29am GMT  \n Chaos at US airports \n  \n  Meanwhile, social media users are posting pictures from US airports \u2013 Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas \u2013 showing general chaos and tightly packed crowds.  \n   \n   \n    #BREAKING: Passengers stuck in long lines for immigration at @DFWAirport tell us there are no offers of hand sanitizer, gloves, or masks from U.S. Customs / Immigration.

Southwest, one of the few U.S. airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was \u201cseriously considering\u201d cutting flights.  \n  US Vice President Mike Pence said restrictions on the UK and Ireland will begin Monday at midnight, barring most non-U.S. citizens from entering the United States who have been in those countries within the last 14 days. They do not bar flights to and from the United States, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel. US airlines are scrambling to shore up capital. Among cost-cutting measures, airlines are offering employees voluntary unpaid leaves of absence to match staffing with flights. On Friday, Delta said it would cut capacity 40% in the next few months, the largest reduction in its history. It will eliminate nearly all flights to continental Europe for 30 days and will park up to 300 aircraft.

El-Erian (@elerianm) March 15, 2020\n    \n   \n  El-Erian, who voiced his concerns to the Guardian three days ago, goes on to say that the impact will be greater than anything experienced by most people in advanced countries \u2013 presumably meaning all those under the age of 75 who can\u2019t remember the second world war or the 1930s depression.Here is an excerpt from his piece:  \n   \n   Think of what is happening as a huge paradigm shift for economies, institutions, and social norms and practices that, critically, are not wired for such a phenomenon. It requires us to understand the dynamics, not only to navigate them well but also to avoid behaviours that make the situation a lot worse.  \n   The bottom line is that the economic disruptions immediately ahead will be more severe and widespread than the ones experienced by the bulk of the population in advanced countries.  \n   We live in a global economy wired for ever deepening interconnectivity; and we are living through a period in which the current phase of health policy \u2014 emphasising social distancing, separation and isolation \u2014 runs counter to what drives economic growth, prosperity and financial stability. The effects of these two basic factors will be amplified by the economics of fear and uncertainty that tempt everyone not just to clear out supermarket shelves but sadly also reignite terrible conscious and unconscious biases. \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.33am GMT  \n  \n  Australia\u2019s new national cabinet is set to meet Sunday.

The government has already advised against non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, though this does not include schools, airports or public transport.  \n  The national cabinet which includes federal, state and territory leaders, dubbed a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d by the media, will hold its first meeting via teleconference on Sunday to discuss the response to the spread of the virus. The meeting is expected to canvas whether schools should be closed and whether border controls should be further tightened to contain Covid-19. \u201cWe are rightly, keeping all options on the table, whether it\u2019s in relation to travel or whether it\u2019s in relation to schools. The schools question will be very much guided by the medical advice,\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt told ABC television.  \n  \u201cOne of the things that they have talked about, is not moving too early on something like that.\u201d Visitors who have been in high-risk nations are already banned from entering Australia, while New Zealand on Saturday said it would require incoming travellers, including its own citizens, to self-isolate for two weeks. \n  \n Updated at 5.40am GMT \n \n \n  1.25am GMT  \n  \n  In Australia, Nine news is reporting that a group of Australian surfers are stuck on their boat in an Indonesian port after they were prevented from disembarking due to measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus.The men told Nine they were down to their last supplies of food and water and they had contacted the Australian government seeking assistance.Guardian Australia has asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for comment and to confirm if they are assisting. \n  \n \n \n  1.22am GMT  \n  \n  Morale boosting efforts deployed from balconies are catching on in Portugal, it seems.

The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the U.S. and caused at least 50 deaths.  \n  The president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus, including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The president, according to two people close to the White House, had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance.  \n  He hasn\u2019t yet tweeted about the result.  \n  \n Updated at 12.46am GMT \n \n \n  12.37am GMT  \n  \n  Just in case you missed this, Donald Trump has tested negative for coronavirus.  \n  A White House physician has issued a statement confirming that Donald Trump does not have Covid-19. \n  It comes after the US president confirmed he had been tested for the virus at a press briefing earlier on Saturday. \n   \n   \n    White House says \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069 test for #coronavirus was negative. pic.twitter.com/gqkj8pIHvR\u2014 Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1) March 14, 2020\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.34am GMT  \n  \n  If you happen to spot interesting or cheering coronavirus news \u2013 or anything I\u2019ve missed \u2013 please do drop me a line on Twitter @helenrsullivan.  \n  \n \n \n  12.25am GMT  \n Summary \n  \n  Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus liveblog.
